Some people  arrested Their release was however secured on condition thai they would not repeat the slogans Yet soon after their release the same elements raised slogans Mr Chavan said there were about 700 policemen on the occasion When Mr Vajpayee rose to interrupt him Mr Chavan remarked Unfortunately you are in the opposition and you do not know how to run the administration Mr Chavan said there were 7000 to 8000 people in the procession which was passing through narrowstreets If the police were to act in such situations one could imagine what would happen Mr Joshi The district mahad asked the authorities whether he should ban the procession here and now Mr Chavan You cannot do it In moving procession it is very difficult to take any decision as it will lead to an unpleasant situation wish sometimes that members take the responsibility of controlling processions in these circumstances They will then know what is law and order JALGAON FLARE-UP About Jalgaon Mr Chavan said What happened in Jalgaon is something which hurts me Jalgaon had no history of communal tension at least for the past 40 years that he had known of the area It had been truly secular He then referred to the fact. that even today the area was represented in the House by his party member Mr Tayeb who had been elected by an overwhelming majority even though Muslims constituted only six or seven per cent But the poison of concrete in the country had also spread to the area It all started rather suddenly He was told it began in some gambling place and within two and half hours 200 Muslim houses were burnt Till February last year 100 Shiv Sena workers were prosecuted and many sentenced Even the leader of the Sena Mr Bal Thackeray was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act and later prosecuted His conviction by lower courts were set aside on appeal and the State Government now to co-in appeal this PTI
