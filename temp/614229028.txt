UPDATE Update On the beat sullenly The Bombay police may have come in for some flak during the recent riots in the city but the force suffers from several basic problems reporting Ambarish Mishra and Harini Swamp Dalt December 9 1992 Venue Varsha the Maharashtra chief ministers official Malabar Hill residence Several newspersons lazed around the neatly-trimmed lawn waiting for the press conference by Sudhakarrao Naiks wireless message in nearby official vehicle cracked the heavy silence of the evening We are only five here against mob of several hundred We don't have enough weapons That just about summed up the mood in the Bombay police force during the worst-ever communal violence that ravaged the metropolis last month The official list of casualties on the other hand offered striking. contrast 202 killed 132 of them in police firing The fact that over half the deaths were caused by the defenders of the law has prompted the state government to appoint one-man inquiry commission. under the former chief secretary DM Sukthankar While the commission will go into the genesis of the riots and the charges of wanton firing and excesses against the police Bombays khaki-clad faces acute crisis of identity We are walking on razor edge says Gangadhar Shinde senior inspector Kasturba Marg police station steady decline in reputation worries the police force which can boast of fairly unblemished record till the late 1970s when crime sheets mentioned gambling and house-breaking as major cases The ultimate idea of sensational crime then was petty thief breaking into the wardrobe of Nawab Ali Yavar Jung the former governor of Maharashtra If Bombays saw himself as the designation of the fabled London Bobby Raman Raghav would surface as the city's answer to Jack the Ripper However the situation underwent drastic change in the mid-1970s The crime graph registered an upward curve along with the city's population and spurt in illegal activities Shortage of manpower is the first and the foremost problem explains senior police official Today 33000 constables and 2400 subspectors police the city with population of nearly crore Low wages poor working conditions and immense work pressure have added Orwellian dimensions to the cops woes Police are paid like unskilled workers admits senior IPS official The chances of upward mobility are few and far between example sub-inspector has to wait for nearly 14 years for his first promotion The working conditions are awful They dont have resource manuals There are not even decent toilets in many police stations says Kalindi Muzumdar post-graduate teacher at the Nirmala Niketan and in-charge of the Institutes Police Project which aims at better police-public relations As has been often stated the average constable operates within frustrating set of circumstances He knows that many of his targets will never be convicted in court either because the process of law takes so excruciatingly long to run it course or because the culprit has good equation with those in the corridors of power. His own basic needs are routinely ignored by his superiors constable earns Rs 1200 per month while sub-inspectors monthly take-home is around Rs 3400 pittance by any standard Also while he is out on riot duty little protection is offered to his family back home he often has to stay out of touch with them for days on end as happened last week The common grouse in the force is that while the area residents insist on application to duty they rarely feel moved even to offer him glass of water It is unfair that public and the media should point an accusing finger at us without so much as bothering find out about our problems says IK Bagwan assistant commissioner of police Zone IX Asks DB Patil subspector attached to the Mata Ramabai Ambedkar police station There are black sheep in the family Rut whv tar the entire Bombay police under stress force The annual budgetary allocation of Rs 42242 crores hardly meets even the elementary demands of the police force The city police continues to lack sophisticated equipment and firearms While the underworld does brandish AK-47s the Bombay cop still struggles with his antiquated 410 muskets World War II relic Even in the latest riot police stations it is said were armed with only five 303 rifles and two bullet-proof jackets to meet what the former city police commissioner Vasant Saraf calls the dynamics of urban guerilla warfare The workload meanwhile continues to grow Whether political rally WIP arrival or bandh the lathi-wielding permanent fixture on the streets of Bombay as the representative of the state Insiders say that the Andheri police station even deputed a team of cops to an exclusive anti-AIDS gathering of 500-plus gays from the suburbs on the New Years day Says Shrikant Bapat the city police commissioner The public needs policing all the time It is unfortunate that citizens don't realise that the main duty of the police is to maintain law and order Madhukar Zende the assistant commissioner of police Pydhonie division People expect miracles from the police They feel we have magic wand The quarterly report of Nirmala Niketan discusses at length the acute work pressure in the police stations In the latest riots policemen have for nearly 62 hours at stretch says Muzumdar Overwork and bad work conditions often lead to bizarre scenario For example sub-inspector Lakshmari Salvi of the Kasturba police station chrome case of nervous breakdown borrowed his colleagues revolver and in fit of depression pumped bullets into his head last Wednesday Political interference often wounds the morale of the force In the recent riots the Deonard police it is learnt had to obtain the go-ahead from the minister of state for home Babarao Pachpute he left the Janata Dal last year and became minister in the Sudhakarrao Naik ministry before arresting dreaded Janata Dal worker who is alleged to have ferried firearms in an ambulance Pachpute immediately gave orders for the local dons arrest Normally we have to keep the political masters in good mood admitted senior official The recent police crackdown on Hitendra Thakur and Pappu Kalani the Congress legislators from Vasai and Ulhasnagar respectively was possible only because the final nod came from Mantralaya This is perhaps why countless police officials feel the film Ardh-Satya comes close being true-to-life account of an inspector The average Hindi film rein forces the popular perception the police tobacco-chewing pot- bellied nitwit caricatured so often on celluloid by furnishers such as Dada Kondke and Kadai Khan Hindi films have corrupted our public image say Deepak Vishwasrao senior in spector attached to the DB Mart police-station It is not very gratifying to go home after gruelling day and see your children watching Hindi where cops are shown leering oil spitting tobacco he adds rueful in The stark reality is that the Bombay police sorely lacks its public relations notwithstanding the eye-catching posters designed by cartoonist RK Laxman showing the legendary common man taking friendly salute from mustachioed policeman Inquiries reveal that there are no regular formalised training and refresher courses for the lower-level cops to initiate them into the fine art of crowd management or public. relations Saraf says with regret that his repeated requests that psychological apart from basic general knowledge and crisis management testing be done as part of the recruitment process have generally fallen on deaf ears Several inspectors freely admit that the crowd dispersal training at the Nasik Training College is not enough The experience of the latest riots has reinforced the widely held belief in the force that separate course is necessary to train the force for an eventuality like communal riots The average Bombay cop is struggling hard to get out of the archetypal Pandu. Havaldar mould sizeable number of subinspectors and inspectors are well-educated some of them post-graduates and are hands-on officials The agenda before the Bombay police will be set by these middle- rung officials who consider the December riots as blessing in disguise It sets us thinking afresh about our role and responsibility says senior inspector Shirish Inamdar
