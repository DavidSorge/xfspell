Gujarat communal riots follow set pattern Bv ASHRAF SAVED The Times of India News Service AHMEDABAD September 1# THE sudden spurt in communal violence in small towns and villages of Gujarat in the Last few days has exposed the designs of some known communal organisations out to achieve petty political goals communal nave reported from Mehsana Sabarkantha Ahmedabad Kaira and Panchmahals districts following systematic rumoured parties during the last week Though the state administration has tried to underplay the seriousness of the incidents by describing them as isolated and insignificant close scrutiny of these incidents reveals the pattern It seems that the Bharatiya Janata Party and its front organisations want to gauge the public mood on how much the Hindu card can be played in the next electoral contest The recent incidents of communal violence indicate that these organisations have fairly succeeded in arousing the religious sentiments of the people GANG WAR For Gang war between the dons of two criminal outfits which led to the murder of youth in the Kheralu town in Mehsana district was given communal twist by motivated propaganda leading to large. scale violence In the communal frenzy one person was stabbed to death and seven others were injured The police fired six rounds to control the situation but only after much damage was done to private. property The incident which was sequel to an earlier murder of rival gang leader was systematically utilised by interested parties to fan the fires of communal hatred in nearby villages of the police Intelligence sources are to be believed volunteers of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad moved from village to village arousing the sentiments of the people in the name of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue within two days of the Kheralu incident violence broke out on September 12 at Malpur Ghorisana Otalpur Kuda and Sidhpur villages of Kheralu taluka in Mehsana district As many as 17 shops were looted and set on fire and eight people got injured GANESH PROCESSION Similarly the first-ever lord Ganesh procession in Kanajari village of Kaira district provided the background for violence The police fired seven rounds to disperse violent mobs Again group clashes also took place on September 1 3 and September 1 5 at Dhandhuka town in Ahmedabad district and Meghraj town in Sabarkantha district respectively in connection with the bandh call given by the Bharatiya Janata Party the VHP and the Shiv Sena to mark the foundation leaving ceremony of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple In span of six days violence resulted in the death of one person and injuries to 30 others As many as 21 shops were looted by mobs forcing the police to open fire 14 rounds During 1985 and 1987 the communal riots were mostly confined to big cities and towns like Ahmedabad Baroda Godhra Bharuch Palanpur and Wapkaner The pattern this time is perceptibly changing Most of the violent incidents are confined to the rural areas It is practically impossible for the law enforcing agencies to provide protection to the people in the far-flung rural areas Invariably the police could reach the affected villages only after the damage had already been done by miscreants Expectedly such isolated but well-planned incidents have created sense of insecurity among the people The Amarsinh Chaudhary ministry cannot afford to ignore the police intelligence reports that some communal organisations are now bent upon whipping up the feelings of the people on the Rani Janmabhoomi issue As it can be made an election issue the BJP and its front organisations are trying their best to mobilise public opinion on it In the past also the BJP had gained political strength after communal violence in Ahmedabad where it captured the city civic body with thumping majority On the other hand rank cow and known bootlegger Abdul Latif Abdul Vahab Shaikh could win from five wards on the sympathy of the Muslims The BJP has also injected new militancy among its front organisations like the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and the VHP This became evident at -- the silver jubilee celebration function of the Sabar dairy held at Himatnagar on September 15 HOSTILE CROWD hostile crowd of nearly 20000 farmers assembled on the occasion not only shooted and abused the chief minister Mr Amarsinh Chaudhary but also threw all kinds of missiles at-i the dais forcing the organisers abandon the function mid-way The chief minister was earlier assured by delegation of farmers that they would behave at the function Moreover the chief minister had given several concessions to in the past which had cost the stat exchequer more than Rs 200 And this time also he has offered to consider all their demands including early payment of crop insurance dues and review of the irrigation rates But the Himatnagar episode was staged to warn the state administration and the Congress party of shape of things to come Not satisfied with the flexing of muscles at HimEfthe BKS has now organised massive rally on September 19 to gherao the state assembly to prove that the Congress is anti-farmer and the BJP is the only organisation fighting for the cause of agriculturists in the state However on the two threats communal one can be potentially the most troublesome The farmer's issue can be debated and sorted out either through negotiations or conceding some of their demands but communal disturbances in the rural can only be ignored at the cost of grave consequences
