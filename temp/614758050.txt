Pulse of the Press HiiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilliM The communal virus IX days ago the nation ll2S Mahatma sSj Gandhis 98th birth an0j3 niversary The occasion EfflagEBEM could not have been more ironic Last month the country witnessed some of the worst communal rioting since partition Kashmir had its first serious Hindu Muslim disturbance in 35 years in Ranchi over 70 persons 200 according to unofficial accounts were killed during an orgy butchery finally 13 persons died in one day alone in Gorakhpur Evidently many of us have forgotten that Gandhiji laid down his life for Hindu-Muslim amity All the verbiage that will pile up during these seven days cannot however hide the shameful fact that the great ideals for which Mahatma Gandhi lived and died lie buried under billions of meaningless words wrote Mainstream in an angry leading editorial Most other journals on the other hand were content to dutifully ask their readers to recall some of Gandhi's ideals Even the Jan Sangh Organiser carried pen-portrait of the Maon its front page with the caption Oh for Gandhi The weekly had the gall to print it alongside characteristically public article headlined Maharashtra Muslims i murderous mood What happened at Ranchi Though the riots there took place over month ago it was only unrelatively recently that journalists began to piece the facts together But if the Indian press failed to convey the gravity of the situation this failure was more than matched by the apathy of our political leaders Dr Ram Manohar Lohia was perhaps the only politician of national significance who went to Ranchi during the clashes were the others unaware of what was happening or is it simply that they could not care less Admittedly two Union Ministers Mr Asoka Mehta and Mr Fakhruddin Ahmed happened to be in Ranchi during the troubles but this seems to have been mere coincidence New Age the official organ of the CPI gave perhaps the most detailed account of the Ranchi dis It pointed accusing finger at one Binoy Ranjan who it alleged was once the private secretary of former Congress Minister Surprisingly Organiser also blamed the same person for inciting the riots by printing highly inflammatory pamphlet though it claimed that Ranjan was secretary of the Congress Youth Front but in explaining subsequent events the two journals diverged Organiser said that the riots were engineered by Pakistani and communist elements while New Age referred to reports that men belonging to the RSS were active participants in the Ranchi riots and were carrying on whisper campaigns. inflaming communal passions Who were the people killed at Ranchi Here again the two weeklies differed Organiser said that the casualties were from both communities whereas New Age reported that 90 per cent belonged to the minority community The latter estimate was probably the more truthful one as it tallied with the figures given by the Union Home Minister Janata the PSP journal carried letter Secretary Reports by the PSP General Secretary which made some more persons For instance it praised the personal bravery of the Bihar Police Minister Mr Ramanand Tiwari something which most journals overlooked But in common with many other journals it placed much of the blame for the riots on the State authorities If as the State Government later claimed the disturbances were pre-planned why did it not do anything to prevent them belatedly the Centre reacted to the communal threat The Union Home Minister sent letter to the State Chief Ministers expressing concern at the incidents in Ranchi He suggested that administrative arrangements be tightened to deal with any threat to communal harmony That in the 21st year by freedom the Centre should still find it necessary to fight the demon of communalism tooth and nail is an admission of failure commented The Tribune The Weekend Review was more specific It criticised Mr Chavan for his unnecessarily defensive attitude regarding objectional writings in the press The weekly wanted the State authorities to take stronger action against that section of the press which battens on spreading communal disaffection and not put their trust in the inadequate Jachinery of the Press Council Links solution to the problem was that secular and democratic parties should come together in united opposition to the communalist-sectarian mischief -monger1 This sounded very much like a code of conduct something which Patriot did not find at all to its liking The faith in codes of conduct has always been touching characteristic of Congress leadership at the national level The outbreak of communal disalmost simultaneously in 60 many places could not have been mere coincidence What was the explanation Patriot took the somewhat easy way out and saw it allas expressions of fundamental economic malaise The Hindustan Times on the other hand warmed up to its familiar theme and viewed the communal scene as an inconsequence of the general permissiveness on law and order that prevails today Rising prices and the breakdown of law and order through no doubt contributory factors cannot entirely explain why one community turns violently on Does the failure not lie with our political leaders who have made little attempt to rid people of their communal bias -Rsr Chavan Belated reaction
