Parishad had been passions for quite SOIT, like However there was hardly any effort on the part of the administration to prevent the communal polarisation The local leaders also chose to the situation to further their politics interests instead of helping the authorities in containing the increasing communalism The result was that on the day ol Shabe Barat on April 14 riots broke out over the playing of loud speakers The disturbances took the toll of 10 lives besides destruction of property worth lakhs of rupees This should have been alarming enough for the administration to take stern measures to curb the growing communalism and activities of the mischievous elements However it did the opposite the curfew was lifted on April 27 The charged atmosphere warranted police presence strict enforcement of section 144 for at least the statutory three months But the authorities thought otherwise Not only this most of the 800 miscreants who were arrested during the riots were also released on bail Meerut has been communal trouble spot The district administration should have considered this before releasing them said Mr Ajit Singh Sethi the Congress MLA from the Meerut Cantonment Constituency Giving details of the sequence of the events which later developed into one of the worst riots this country has ever witnessed the district magistrate Mr Kaushik said on May 20 that the killing of resident of Mohalla Kaichiyan Mr Ajay Sharma over tenancy dispute was interpreted in communal terms as the FIR lodged by the brother of the deceased charged six persons of the minority community Four of them were arrested within two days The next day passed off without any trouble However on May 18 Mr Kaushik said around 8 pm the explosion of country bomb in Chipiwada sparked off clash between two groups belonging to two different communities About the same time was set on fire in Surajkund area about two km from Chipiwada Police contingents were rushed to situation at both the places Mr Kaushik said The incidents should have alerted the authorities to increase the vigil in the sensitive areas Police pickets should have been posted at all the trouble spots during the month of Ramzaan when Muslims gather in large numbers in mosques for collective and collective recitation of the Quran resident of Mausampura Mr Mohammad Azhar said However the police made the mistake of going to make some preventive arrests from the Mohalla Imliyan at the time of Sahari about 3 o'clock in the morning of May 19 Mr Kaushik told me that the arrests were made 2 am and 500 am at Sahari1 when Muslims have their meals before starting the next days fast The coming of the police at the time of Sahari was enough provocation for the residents to come out of their houses defend the attack on their faith resident of Imliyan said at the Medica College Moreover due to our bad experience while under police during the April riots we all decided to prevent the police from making the arrests he added Lanes were blocked with drums etc At some places the residents lied down on the road to prevent police entry Mi Kaushik admitted at the press on May 20 that at least one child was crushed to death by police vehicle The Imliyan resident said thai rumours were heard that Hindus had surrounded the area This led to announcements from the fitted mosque calling upon the residents to come out to fight in the name of religion small police contingent which had come to make the arrests soon took to heels as the crowd kept swelling Then started the large-scale destruction and rioting which soon engulfed large parts of the city to be continued
