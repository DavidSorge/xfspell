COMMUNAL RIOTS--II COMMUNAL RIOTS II Views differ on police action Bv SINGH MORADABAD OF the several eye-witness accounts of the black Wednesday August 13# carnage at the Idaho 1 heard during my stay in Moradabad the one told by Muslim youth at the house-cum-surgery of the city imam Dr Kamal Fahim was both coherent and credible dozen Muslim leaders present concurred by their silence. If they had any violent disagreement with any material aspect of the narration am sure they would have corrected it According to the young narrator he had found space in the Muslim League tent among dozen tents. pu up on the occasion where ie offered the Id prayers The vast grounds of the Idah had been to and the congregation had spilled over to the road in front After the mass prayers the was about to complete his Jchutba1 discourse when the youth saw some commotion on one side did not know how it all began or what it was about he said But saw some people throwing bricks ostensibly at pig but actually at the PAC asked the SSP to order the arrest of the miscreants In fact 1 led him by the arm towards the scene of commotion Some policemen moving ahead of him wielded their lathis to make way for him Just then brick hit the SSP and he started bleeding The PAC burst tear-gas shells and started firing straight into the congregation The use of by few policepien cannot be called lathi-charge. in formal sense But asked the youth whether the tear-gas shells had exploded some people had suggested that they did not burst because of dampness The youth replied that he himself had taste of the nauseating tear-gas smell From the narration by the Muslim youth and others two surmises can be made First the PAC opened fire after 15 minutes of which goes to disprove the charge that it acted without provocation Secondly firing into the crowd inside the Idaho rather than take firm action against the small group of on the road was gross over-reaction by force that seemed to have gone berserk at the sight pi blood oozing out of the head of its -seniormost official and the presence at what it somehow thought was mammoth hostile crowd Some PAC men subsequently looted or burnt Muslim shops and houses or helped Hindu goonda elements to do so Their partisan behaviour narrowed the wrath of the Muslims While intending to revert to its role in the next article should mention here that the PAC is not without its defenders though they all belong to the Hindu community If the PAC had not opened fire Hindu lawyer said -the miscreants would have caused widespread damage to life and property in the neighbourhood The PAC should be commended and rewarded rather than demoralised and punished and sent back to the barracks Both Muslims and Hindus agree1 that the trouble was ignited by group of miscreants though they differentiated on Page 9 Column 2 No arms purchased by foreign aid Continued from Page 1 Column fear about their identity The Hindus say the group consisted of belchawielding Khaksars and elements from the Muslim League and Jamaat-eMami The Bar Association ha alleged that the Khak6ars started tracking government and police officers and Hindu of the peace committee with bricks knives and firearms The Muslims on the other hand maintain that the miscreants were outsiders hinting that they might have been Harijans nursing ance against the Muslims for beating up bridegroom of their caste some time ago The miscreants the city imam noted were clad in identical kurtas and pyjamas and they did not participate in the maiss prayers The judicial inquiry 6# the government might perhaps shed light on the identity of the group and on other issues agitating the public mind such as the extent of pre-planning foreign instigation and use of firearms But the charge that the bad brought firearms with them can be dismissed right away Nobody has of course suggested that the bulk of Muslims had any intention of creating trouble if they had they would not have brought children with them FIRE-ARMS ISSUE However to suggest that the mishad brought weapons with them is also difficult to believe First it is not easy to hide firearms under summer clothes in broad daylight especially when large number of security men are present all over the place Secondly the nature of non-Muslim deaths and injuries do not suggest the use of firearms on the spot Countrymade guns were used subsequently in firing from housetops and from streets but not at the Idgah The existence of large number of licensed and unlicensed arms in Mois common knowledge and it is sad on the efficiency of the district administration Allegations are made that substantial bribes political pressure and policy of appeasement are responsible for the grant of licences Yet it is patently absurd. to say that only Muslims have benefited from these factors Hindus to possess both legal and illegal weapons Moradabad Rampur and other nearby towns are vast gun factory and anyone with means can acquire weapon While the district authorities must seriously review the arms licensing policy point made by the city imam is worth taking note of He maintains that licensed arms are seldom misused and that goonda elements normally depend on illegal or stolen weapons Contrary to some earlier reports no sophisticated weapons have been found in Moradabad The three seized are no more than ordinary iron pipes mounted on wooden planks PACs IMAGE The theory of pre-planning is based on the quick hair reaction to the Moradabad disturbances in other towns and on the fact that the PAC was the target of attack everywhere But it is backed by insufficient evidence The PAC's image among the Muslims in UP has long been tarnished past conduct and the chain attacks on it may simply be due to emotional reaction to alarming first reports spread by word of mouth and telephone about the Moradabad massacre The presence of overstaying Pakistan by itself prove for instigation Though some of them may have in able activities the majority prolong their stay allegedly by greasing police palms for economic family and other reasons such as the poor living conditions in Pakistan and the reason freedoms imposed by this military dictatorship The Pakistani nationals cannot be unaware of the fact that suspicion would be directed towards them at the slightest hint of trouble and they would be thrown out promptly However the contention of 6ome Muslim leaders that no foreign country including Pakistan has anything gain by creating communal disin India is far from valid Jakistari has much to gain by tarIndia6 secular image abroad in Arab countries friendly 0 us The flow of petro-dollars lies onto the prosperity of Moradafamous brassware industry Of the total output of Rs 100 crores ear half is exported and most of the West Asian nations However both Muslims and Hindus beEighty per cent of the wholesalers and exporters are Hindus though the top ten are Muslims 75 cent of the artisans engaged in the industry are also Muslims FOREIGN AIDI Some of the foreign financial assistance given for religious and ediipurposes may indeed find its to the pockets of individual Muslims and can be misused But here is little evidence to suggest that has been used for purchasing arms If affluence breeds arrogance then ioth communities are guilty of it Just affluence also gives the people 1 Vested interest in peace and quiet disorders mean destruction of life in property and loss of business contrary to the interests of the affluent sections of society The conclusion is inescapable that political and economic factors contributed to the recent disorders as much as anything else The Congress smashing victories in1 he last elections with overwhelming support of the Muslims created political jealousies The Muslim League which has been humiliated at the hustings as very other political parties might ie wanting to win away the Muslims from the ruling party by creating disaffection it In spite of prosperous brassware the bulk of the towns powering hand-to-mouth existence in congested and unhygienic lolilies many deprived of the basic needs to be concluded
