MEERUT-II MEERUT-II Middle class involved in riots News Analysis Bv ASKARI ZAIDI MEERUT city had never witnessed violence of this magBesides the official death roll of more than 100 over 600 houses and commercial establishments have been destroyed in the riots The judicial inquiry ordered into the Mallyana carnage will establish the chronology of the events and the circumstances leading to among other things the recovery of the dead bodies from the Hindon and Ganga canal But the larger question is can the Meerut riots be explained away merely as total failure of administrative machinery Doing so would amount to skirting the basic issues because besides local factors like business rivalry in the handloom trade and lapses of the administration there are many other issues which emerge from the Meerut experience which are pointers to an extremely grim future scenario major part of Uttar Pradesh has witnessed tremendous time ever since the issue of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janambhoomi Both the minority and the majority communities have used the issue to whip up passions The recent rally in Delhi was indicative of the growing aggressiveness of the minorities The Babir masjid Action Committee and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have not lost single opportunity to stoke the fire Attempts were made during the Meerut riots to use mosques in the same way as Gurudwaras used in Punjab to spread political messages Most ominously following the unlocking of the disputed shrine by the order of judicial magistrate the propaganda of the leaders of the minority community that the judiciary too had lost all credibility has found increasing adherents With both communities emotionally charged the present month of Ramazan has been the most tense in recent history Thus when violence erupted in Meerut and later spilled over to other parts of western UP and Delhi observers were not exactly surprised because tension had been prevailing in this part of the country quite some time The significance of the Meerut riots lies in the changing nature of the communal violence in the country As was witnessed during the November 1984 riots in Delhi and elsewhere several persons were burnt alive in Meerut Houses were set on fire with mobs waiting outside to shoot down those who tried to run out of the house Inquiries at the hospitals in Meerut revealed that most Victims had suffered gun-shot injuries Such brutality is recent trend Another new and ominous development was the active involvement of middle class youth in acts of violence and arson In fact the riots would not have spread to middle class localities like Shastri Nagar had the educated middle class not participated in actual violence This reporter is witness to many such incidents in State. Bank colony Chhipi Tank and Shastri Nagar Houses of particular community were selected in the locality for attacks The famous Urdu poet Mr Bashir Badr is one such victim whose house in Shastri Nagar was burnt to ashes Fortunately he was away in Delhi and his family members were given shelter in the house of Hindu neighbour These riots were different also in that they spilled over to the adjoining rural areas Except for the MaUyana incident in which the PACT apparently went berserk and killed many other incidents reported from the villages like Abdulpur Jataoli and Kaseru Khera were of minor nature Yet they were the grim reminders of the partition riots which had affected the rural areas as much as they did the cities Concluded The first part of this analysis on the Meerut riots was published on Tuesday May 26
