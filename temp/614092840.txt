Fresh Flare-Up In Aligarh Time To Face Unpleasant Facts By 1NDER MALHOTRA NO apology need be offered for returning to the subject of the communal carnage in Aligarh for the third week running fresh flare-up in that unfortunate university town exactly last month after the October 5 riot situation that only those national unity can fail to sit up Since few viruses are more content than the communal one it is not surprising that tension has already spread to Moradabad Sambhal Meerut Varanasi Kanpur and some other UP cities and towns which like Aligarh have for long been trouble-spots all this is happening just on the eve of the major Muslim festival of Id-ui-Zuha It therefore appears unlikely that the situation will be defused quickly enough to enable the Muslim community to celebrate the festival peacefully and not under the protection of armed patrols Moreover even if the so-called normalcy is restored it will not be easy to return to the kind of peace that prevailed till earlier this year We seem to be back to the dangerous sixties when we had series of major riots Bhopal Bhiwandi Ahmedabad Bombay and so on riot must doubtless be put down with an iron hand But is only the ugliest manifestation of the more basic and enduring problem of communal prejudice and hatred As such the quelling of communal riot does not and cannot mean restoration of communal harmony any more than the absence of war in the international arena spells peace ENDEMIC That too is not all Violence has become endemic in this country of continental size and countless diversities At any given time some Indians somewhere are busy killing or maiming some of their fellow countrymen out of some insane passion language and parochial pride for instance have often driven so gentle people as the Assamese to go on rampage against the Bengalis living in their midst through both the linguistic groups belong to the Hindu community The motivation behind the Shiy Senas attacks on South working in Bombay is too yell known to need explaining In sheer barbarity nothing can seat the horrors which the so-called upper caste Hindus perpetrate the luckless Harijans or the Girijans Even the Sunni and 5hia Muslims fight pitched battles with unfailing regularity at least 1 men year in the city of Lucklow Of latethe Afcali Sikhs have literally taken to the sword their conflict with the Niran is comparable to that between the of the PaJMuslims the Ahmed yet these orgies of violence by no means infrequent inconsequential as nasty and destructive or 1 cave behind trail of is lasting as do the recurring riots between the Hindus and the Muslims Why vi There is of course the Head1 weight of history recent and re more This coupled with the re large size of the Muslim minority has created tragical paradoxical situation For ever while wallowing in 6elf-pity the undoubted discrimination deprivation and the sense of right they suffer from some Muslims do occasionally tend to be unduly aggressive Complaints the communalists within the majority community that riots arc often started by the members of the minority community arc nol always wholly wrong But fi some Muslims do err they ought to be dealt with according to the law Their misdoings cannot justify retaliatory mob violence And no matter who starts riot and for what purpose the worst sufferer is always the minority. community SUSPICIONS The situation in Aligarh has been aggravated by some factors On the one hand the widespread suspicion of the complicity in the Aligarh killings of the RSS which is part of the ruling establishment through the erstwhile Jana Sangh has exacerbated feelings in areas extending far beyond UP On the other hand the obscurantist and extremist elements among the Muslims have become more powerful than before thanks partly to the moral and monetary sustenance they receive from the overseas Islamic fundamentalists now in the ascendant almost throughout the Muslim world This plays straight into the hands of the fanatics within the majority community The vicious circle is thus complete In these circumstances what is required is an imaginative political initiative not merely after riot but also at times which are described as normal to bridge the chasm which divides the majority and the minority and breeds fears and suspicions which eventually lead to overt violence. Such an initiative has been out by its absence On the contrary political failure both at the city and the state level has been principal cause of the renewed carnage in Aligarh on scale even bigger than the one on October after the previous riot was supposed to have been quelled and the prolonged curfew withdrawn there ought to have been some attempt by all sane elements in politics and more so by the ruling Janata Party to heal the wounds cool down inflamed passions and start vigorous drive to rehabilitate the victims Not only was this not done but prominent person from outside Aligarh with past affiliations with the RSS on the one hand and extremist Muslim parties on the other were allowed to come there and make objectionable speeches What has infuriated the minority community the secular sections Nof the majority community in Aligarh however is the long delay on the part of the state government in taking action against the instigators of trouble description which is surely includes those named in series of FIRs filed with the police by the riot victims and witnesses Mr Ram Naresh Yadav's statement after the second riot that no action could be taken because C1D includes still in progress is weak apologia for poor political judgement No less regrettable than Lucknow's ineptitude is what must be described as Nenv Delhis insensitivity Mr Morarji Desais stubborn reluctance to rush to the scene of killing arson and looting may or may not be understandable But what about his deputies in the Union ministry of home affairs Could they not have been asked to be on the spot to help Mr Yadav cope with an extremely grim situation and to convey to the affected people the Centres concern over their plight Strangely even Mr Sikandei Bakht has not felt called upon to go to Aligarh and stay put there It is perhaps arguable that movisits to areas of or man-made disasters can be hindrance rather than help But are the Janata leaders so out of touch with reality as to be unaware that in politics there is such thing as style and that people in distress do want to see their rulers and leaders in their midst Even so it is shocking that an utterly non-communal incident should have sparked off this week's riot In wholly personal dispute Muslim youth stabbed another of his own community But in next to no time the entire town was swept by rumours that the Muslims had killed Hindu and hell broke loose VARSITY In the grisly events that have since followed it has become disclear that the provincial armed constabulary PAC has forfeited the confidence of the minority. community in the city almost completely That is why the deployment of the border security force became necessary and its director-general Mr Ashwini Kumar decided to be on the spot personally Law and order may be state subject under the constitution But riots and atrocities on the Harijans cannot be dismissed as mere law and order problem It is time therefore to devise through co-operation between the Centre and the states extremely mobile highly trained specially equipped and properly motivated anti-riot squads like the ones even the US once found neto cope with racial violence between the blacks and the whites To its credit the Aligarh Muslim university has been free from trouble so far. How ironic then that some individuals and groups should continue to regard it as hotbed of Muslim communalism and pro-Pakistan activities This must end and no effort literally no effort should be spared to ensure that the university is not dragged into the fires of communalism which are playing havoc with the city This must be among the first charges of the BSF
