communities in Behrampada Why then does it still burn According to Aslam Shaikh who works in nut and bolt factory it is the pro-Sena residents of the adjacent Kherwadi who created problems The local leaders have armed their cadres who intimidate the white-collared residents of the New MIG colony next to the slum and use the terraces of their buildings to rain fire on the defenceless slumwellers
