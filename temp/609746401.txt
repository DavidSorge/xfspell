Political Commentary Trilogy Of National Shame By INDER MALHOTRA TJ VEN those inured to the march of JZviolence and folly in the country must have been shocked by succession of three particularly. nasty outrages in just over fortnight For between them they underscore the degeneration of the Indian state and society to depth that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago Merely to recall the bare facts of the three acts of infamy is enough to make one hang ones head in shame score of income-tax go to Muzaflarnagar and Bijnore west UP towns no more than hundred miles from the national capital to do their lawful duty of raiding the premises of some busies evidently suspected of tax evasion They are set upon by the self-same businessmen beaten black and blue and in some cases injured seriously The district authorities and the police merrily look the other way The raids cannot be conducted In fact the tax men have to beat an ignominious retreat Official Inaction It takes nearly ten days and quite some pressure from the Union finance ministry before the state government can be persuaded to bestir itself and take even semblance of action against the culprits meanwhile the powerful political connections of these fat cats are adequately publicised providing due to the earlier official inaction and adding to both the fury and the fears of income tax employees all over the country Ironically it is the income-tax staff still reluctant to resume work that is being threatened with dire action while most of the perpetrators of the outrage are strutting about on bail at. Muzaflarnagar and Bijnore the police were guilty of inaction and passivity but at Nadiad in Gujarat they have hammered home the message that innocent and decent people might be better off if the police do not act than if they do The case of the luckless chief magistrate of Nadiad has by now become major international scandal and is in any case before the Supreme Court Therefore nothing more need be said about this Unspeakable incident for the present except to make general point about the police No one should minimise the multiple strains under which the police all over the country have been working for dose to two decades The relentless politicisation of the force in almost every state has played havoc with its morale cohesion and discipline Even so the egregiously lawless behavior of sections of the police in place after place has begun to raise the ominous question whether the fence hasn't started eating the field it was supposed to protect Neither the police nor the politicians have covered themselves with glory in the third outrageous event under discussion which took place at Badaun UP town Having remained free from the communal virus all through the 42 years. of independence it has now become the scene of communal carnage of the worst type No fewer than 24 people lost their lives virtually in the course of day according to official figures generally. believed to be an underestimate More shockingly the attack on railway train followed by selective killing of passengers has brought back to the populace benumbing memories of the savagery that had marked the massacres accompanying independence and partition The question may well be asked as to what is so special about the Badaun killings Did not equally virulent communal riots disgrace Kota Rajasthan and Mhow in Madhya Pradesh well before Badaun blew up They most certainly did just as Khargone and Ratlam went up in flames later But the eruption of madness at Badaun has distinction both. dubious and dangerous that should not be lost sight of The bloodbath there was related directly and exclusively to the Urdu language and to nothing else not even the vexed Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute which has rendered all over North India so inflammable that even the smallest spark can start raging fire Language Bill There is no doubt that timing of the UP governments bill to make Urdu the second official language in the state was opportunistic self-seeking and aimed at winning the Muslim vote This brings one to the point that chronology is not the only connecting threat between the three sordid episodes under discussion Nor is their horrendous nature their only common feature They also have running through them the joining thread of crass electoral or political. considerations or calculations of someone or the other The pampering of the law-breaking Muzaffarnagar moneybags had lots to do with the dout they are bound to wield in the coming poll Mr Amarsinh Chaudhurys Pavlovian reflex of rushing to the defence of the indefensible Nadian policemen bespeaks of the frailties of weak politician beleaguered by powerful factions in his own party And Badaun has become the depressing symbol of how low both sides are prepared to stoop for petty electoral advantage The opposition parties are justified in blaming the Congress ministry in UP for rushing in the language bill just three months before the elections have neglected the problem for full five years But has their own behaviour especially that of the BJP been any better This party has been congratulating itself on haying excluded from its election manifesto the emotive Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid issue But who is it trying to take in The wide world knows that on the Ram Janambhoomi question passions have already been aroused as high as they could have been by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and its allies on the one hand and the Babri Masjid Action Committee and Muslim fundamentalists groups on the other The party has only to sit back and reap the rich harvest of Hindu votes on this score It is this which makes the BJP performance over the UP Urdu Bill all the more deplorable By opposing the measure tooth and nail in intemperate language and through objectives the party has contributed cynically to the terrible repercussions in Badaun The Janata Dal was content with questioning the Congress motive but letting the Bill go through Why could not the BJP follow suit especially when it had not even squeaked in Bihar months earlier when the law making Urdu the second language in that state promulgated in some districts six years ago was extended to the whole of Bihar Although it may be like crying in the wilderness an attempt should be made to put in brief words for Urdu one of the most elegant languages in the world and an integral part of this country's rich and composite heritage which has unfortunately become the most tragic casualty of the partition of the subcontinent on both sides of the divide Sensible Document Shockingly all concerned including those who have given Urdu the second language status in UP just three months before the election others who have opposed the move vehemently take it for granted that Urdu is the language of Muslims alone It is not It is spoken and used by millions of Hindus and Sikhs The number of Indians who are not Muslims and yet compose poetry or write novels and short stories in Urdu legion Mr Haksar when asked during visit to Pakistan in 1972 as Mrs Indira Gandhi envoy what language he would speak in replied In my mother-tongue Urdu of course The largest circulating Urdu daily in India is Hind Samachar run by the late Lala Jagat Narains family as has survived And yet many screamed all night in the US assembly that by giving Urdu the second language status the government would perpetuate the polarisation between Hindus and Muslims What really needs to be Urdu is contained in the Indian Gujarat Committees report Why this sensible document remains unimplemented and largely unknown 14 years after it was submitted is long and painful story It must be told however some other time if only for reasons of space
