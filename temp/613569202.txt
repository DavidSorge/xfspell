He alleged that in spite of several reminders leading national daily had refused to publish his version of the controversy over the Babri mosque historical documents raised by the Vishwa Hindu ParProf Habib said the treatment meted out to the national media at Ayodhya was yet another proof of the fascist tendencies of Hindu communal organisations In fact several senior professors praised the role of the national press and conceded that the national press had become more sensitive to the Muslim view point primarily because Muslims themselves had acted with restraint in the last one year It is no secret that in recent months growing section of the Muslim intelligentsia in private conversations had started promoting the highly controversial proposal of shifting the mosque and settling the matter once and for all Now all that has gone Yet there. is still light at the end of the tunnel number of Hindu teachers live in the AMU campus On Monday night when tension rose once again all over the city one of them Prof Singh calmly refused suggestions that he move to safer locality He said The day my confidence in my Muslim neighbours is broken part of my soul will die.
