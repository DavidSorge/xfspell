Countdown To The Poll Myth Of Minority Block Bv DAS ONE of the myths which inform the hocus pocus practised by poll pundits under the color of psephology is that Indian minorities vote as block So deeply has the myth taken root not only among analysts but even among political establishments that many electoral strategies are premised on this assumption Indeed the pernicious nature of this belief is at the heart of the sorry fact of Indian political life that the road to the polls is often paved with violent communal and caste incidents engineered with the intent of either garnering the supposedly homogeneous block vote of the minorities or consolidating the votes of the majority community In either case there is cynical play with the minority or the majority cards The problem with building electoral houses of cards however is that they are apt to collapse Nevertheless in the meanwhile on account of the material force that even incorrect ideas acquire they do immense damage both innocent people and the nation at large Communal Violence In the present case too as the country lumbers up to the hustings the outbreak of communal and caste violence seems to indicate that the mirage of the en bloc minority vote is being pursued by different participants in electoral steeplechase Most recently there have been communal conflagrations in and around Kota in Rajasthan rash of communal incidents has broken out in Bihar in Hazaribagh Sasaram Bhagalpur Munger Palamau Nalanda and elsewhere Caste conflict has taken bloody toll in Bod Kandamanur and Theni in Tamil Nadu and the invidious Ram Janmabhoomi juggernaut rumbles on inexorably leaving in its wake heightened religious passions Serious analysis requires the raising of many questions in this context There are three which are most important First who instigates these conflagrations Second who is likely to reap electoral benefits if any and third are the underlying assumptions of block voting which such cynical and cruel calculation implies at all correct In other words is their evidence to suggest block voting by minorities To begin with we will address the third question myth repeated many times seems to acquire the characteristics of truism However not all self-evident propositions are necessarily true The one related to minority block voting is one such Anyone who is in the least familiar with election data should not make such an assumption analysts of voting behaviour go wrong on block franchise and vote banks because they carry out political election analysis in isolation from an understanding of the historical sociological characteristics of different Indian communities It is simplistic in the extreme to see Indian Muslims for instance as one homogeneous group long time ago. Daniel Thorner had divided the Indian population into three types manic Kisan me division is as applicable to Muslims as to Hindus Only the naive of the disingenuous will ignore the differences between the peasant-type Muslims of the rural Western UP rooted in the soil indistinguishable in many respects from their Hindu Jat and Gujjar brethren and the relatively more urbanized malik-type sophisticates of Aligarh and Lucknow As regards the former since it is their kisan characteristic that is most significant in defining their social group personality it is almost axiomatic that their political behaviour should follow peasant preferences rather than be determined by calls of religion Some recent events like the Bhopa agitation led by Chaudhry Mahendra Singh Tikait and several Gujjar gatherings comby Mr Rajesh Pilot have made it clear that these are suprareligious occurrences If that is true and if the idea of the AhirJat-Rajput-Gujjar vote block is also void then quite. obviously there is no such thing as specifically Muslim vote bank The differences between the Muslims of Western UP the urban Malik-type Muslims of Aligarh Lucknow etc and the predominantly Juliaha- Ansari impoverished -turned-poor peasant mazdoorMuslims of Eastern UP and Bihar are so deeply sociological and economic that they transrelatively transient electoral concerns Different Patterns event the myth of homogeneity and uniform political block voting is accepted only by those who wilfully dose their eyes to facts like the disparate record of the voting by Muslims even in the relatively small electoral arena of West Bengal There while Malda Muslims vote one way Murshidabad Muslims vote differently In Greater Calcutta itself there are constituencies with substantial Muslims presence which have gone to the Congress or to the CPM quite against the prevailing hawa in the state and the country Evidence of contradictory patterns of Muslim voting election after election Secunderabad and elsewhere in Andhra Pradesh in Malabar and elsewhere in Kerala in the Konkan and elsewhere in Maharashtra should bun the psephological bubble of block voting The fact is that whatever the extent of religious passions one of the successes of Indian democracy is that elections are no longer apocalyptic events They have become routine exercises in the day-to-day politics of India As such it is the concern with day-to-day issues that determines voting patterns Elections are more an articulation of feelings about the price of sugar rather than of thoughts about pies in the sky The structure of everyday life of contemporary India has engendered its own temporarily even to the point of diluting the country's much-vaunted spiritualism In the process it had also created its own living secularism which is not reflection of grand ideal but of mundane reality Muslim today approaches the oi power nui as being but as any other supplicant and if in Kishanganj he votes for Syed Shahabuddinit is not because of edicts of the Shariyat but because of the price of jute The political and in particular electoral expression of this is in terms of secular class or even casteist. behaviour The pricking of the bubble of block voting by minorities however brings us back to the other two questions posed earlier who initiates pre-election communal violence and who is likely to gain from it The answers lie in the fragmented nature of Indian politics Just as the fragmented nature of minority voting has been deliberately brushed under the carpet by electoral strategists so the fragmented nature of the vicious communal politics of the country is often sought to be obscured by recourse to stereotypes In today's India it is clear that playing the Hindu card is not the monopoly of the RSS or BJP alone but indeed is prevalent among almost all parties particularly those who style themselves centrist Neither the Congress nor the Janata Dal has given evidence of being able to resist the temptation of playing communal politics for short-term gains Worse the internally fragmented nature of these political formations has so personalized power centres that political strategy has passed beyond being party matter to one determined by factions groups and left individuals As such we can witness the tussle on the communal question in the Janata Dal and on its fringes between on the one hand the likes of the pro-BJP Mr Arun Nehru of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid-gategame and of avowed like Syed Shahabuddin on the other In the Congress we see the spectacle of Dr Jagannath Mishra desperately summoning opposition support for an anti-communal campaign to hold back his fast-dwindling Muslim support base even as Bihar minister issued gun licences liberally in Sasaram in the few days that preceded the outbreak of the first serious communal conflict in that town since the time of Sher Shah Suit Electoral Politicking Who then instigates pre-election communal. violence For the moment all that needs to be said is that the pattern of recent violence indicates change in the old communal map of India New centres of gration like Kota and Sasaram have emerged even as chronic sites like Ahmedabad or Jamshedpur are mercifully quiet for the time being undoubtedly the invocation of the symbolism of the old-new mobilisation the passing around of bricks by resurgent Hindu groups in manner reminiscent of the circulation of rotis before the great revolt of 1857 is stoking communal fires But the very pattern of communal violence affecting new areas indicates certain decentralisation of communal electoral politicking by local-level warlords of both centrist formations trying to consolidate their position by raising we-themed dichotomies
