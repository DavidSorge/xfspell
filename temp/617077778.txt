India aflame By Dileep Padgaonkar THE evidence is loud and clear the demons who performed dance macabre in 1947 occupy centre-stage again today The litany of hate and bigotry that followed partition. is to be heard once more louder shriller more raucous than at any time in the past It is not as if the morbid litany had died down altogether during these 43 years It had not From time to time burst forth in one corner of the country or the other sending chill up the spine of poor backward and beleaguered community professing faith in Islam But the music died down as abruptly as it erupted with the result that the secular conscience of the nation could draw comfort from the fact that India when pitted against its theocratic neighbour could legitimately claim to be the upholder of Nobler social order Today this claim lies shambles in all but name As communal strife spreads like prairie fire it leaves in its wake not just death and destruction but far more significantly charred Hopes of the nation It has been India's pride that over the centuries it enabled diverse even divergent range of faiths and beliefs to co-exist if not always in harmony and peace then at least in spirit of live and let live The divinities India has revered preached tolerance so did its most honoured mortals While abodes of worship were erected for the divinities and statues of the mortals everyone seemed to agree that the place of pride for the India held in awe was not physical site or structure not book or priestly hierarchy not code of conduct set of rituals for conglomerate of symbols but something stunningly simpler cherished figment of the imagination In this imagination gods and goddesses could be courted and chastised teased taunted and adored with equal vigour It is in India alone that new faiths could be assimilated absorbed or at the very least accommodated with the result that no one would be burnt at the stake for the sins of heresy and apostasy This lively. eclectic open tradition is now sought to be challenged by those who regard religion not as an aid for self-fulfilment nor even as an arena where the spirit can be freely enriching itself as it enriches others along the way but as privileged weapon to acquire and wield political power To serve their ends the votaries of Hindutva pervert the very sense and larger purpose of Hinduism Where quintessential Hinduism regards the other as manifestation of the divine Hindutva zealots see the other as an implacable enemy The former resorts to reason intuition music and poetry to reach out to the other the latter to invective prejudice hate bombs and daggers to terrorise the other and wherever possible to annihilate him The most abject tragedy today is that as the massacre of Muslims becomes routinised that vast section of the political class which swears by the secular thrust of the constitution is unable to rise above its self-serving pursuits No less abject is the other tragedy the thinking elites of this country are yet to be consumed by shame or remorse over the appalling miseries we are heaping on our fellow citizens Worse still more and more hi these very elites sentiment is swiftly gaming ground that the miseries are no more than just proper retribution for the supposed injustices both past and present perpetrated by the minorities their religious belief is an anathema their social practices are blot on the national agenda for modernisation their loyalties are forever suspect and so it is that the other has become the object of the nations accumulated fears frustrations anger and disillusionment The killings in Uttar Pradesh Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat should evoke revulsion and beyond revulsion urgent soulsearching If the violence against the minorities continues unabated India runs the serious risk of disintegration even as the rest of us run the risk of losing our most precious assets.
