Hindi Captainist Wave Revival Of ComjamM By PREM SHANKAR In recent weeks Muslim leaders like Syed Shahabuddin the Janata member of Parliament Mr Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait the president of the Indian Union Muslim League and number others have cried themselves hoarse that there is a wave of Hindu nism in the country and that militant fascist ie Hindu comes spread to the ranks of the government the police and district administration1 They have therefore organised petitions by Muslim MPs to ban the RSS and exhorted Muslim ministers at the Centre and in the states to resign in protest against the treatment being meted out to their coreligionists The1 very least that can be said about these attempts to mobilise specifically Muslim opinion is that they are misguided and that they are based on simplistic view of complicated situation But what cannot be ruled out is that they may also be communal in Communalism is an ideology and all ideologies are notoriously impatient with facts Indeed they gain their power to move large masses of people precisely by abstracting from and simplifying the complex reality What Mr Shahabuddin and his MP colleagues are doing is to view the Hindu-Muslims conflict in isolation from its social and historical setting arid in particular to divorce it from the process of economic transformation that is shaking Indian society to its roots doing this are seeking -to divorce the communal conflict from all other types of conflict that characterise period of social transformation and thereby to give it special almost dental character Nothing could be more dangerous Mass Frenzy Of Past No one who bothers to look closely at the history of communal violence in India can fail to be struck by the change in its character in the last 30 years The earliest incidents were genuine outbursts of insensate violence in which hundreds of lives were lost in matters of hours and entire villages were decimated and abandoned These took place mostly in the immediate aftermath of partition but continued till as late as 1964 as the West Bengal Assam and Tripura massacres would show Most of these were concentrated in eastern India and were caused by the maltreatment of the Hindu minority in what was then East Pakistan and particularly by reports of molestation of Women The 1964 riots were triggered by reports that over thousand people had been killed in Dacca and Narayanganj and over hundred thousand rendered homeless Several thousands crossed the border and their harrowing tales set off the ratio in India In the ensuing riots according to official statistics 208 persons were killed and another 56 die in police firings The former figure is almost certainly an understatement for no less than 146,000 people left their homes of Who 13000 never returned By the late sixties however this kind of mass frenzy had already become thing of the past This is why the far more harrowing tales of the Bangladesh refugees in 1971 failed to cause. single riot in India Sporadic violence between the Hindus and the Muslims did however continue But these incidents were planned not spontaneous and clearly an outcome of sharpening political and economic competition within the country In the events that preceded outbursts such as those at Ahmedabad and Bhiwandi in 1969 and 1970 the manoeuvring of political parties clearly be discerned The Bhiwandi riots for instance resulted from the jockey ing for power in the city by newly cemented and eventually short-lived alliances between the Jana Sangh and the Shiv Sena These riots were also character by far greater damage to The aim seemed as often to people of particular out 6th particular city or area to seize their jobs shops homes The Ranchi carnage of August 197 was perhaps the in w dominant economic motive could be discerned Refugees from Punjab had deep inroads into certain trades traditionally practised toy the Muslims such as fruit and vegetable vending and driving against there was definite resentment among some Htn dust against the Muslims who had obtained jobs at newly set up Heavy Engineering Corporation But in Rartchi these issues were submerged in the explosion of pent-up ill-feeling that had been generated by the Bengal riots of 1964 and the war of 1965 Professional Instigators Till the Ahmedabad of 1969 the increasingly professional instigators of communal riots found it fairly easy to provoke some mass violence Indeed they were able to hide their role as agents provocateurs But in the 1970s as genuine communal animosity abated still further this became increasingly difficult In Bhiwandi the selective manner in which powerloom operators traders and stockists often of dangerously inflammable paints and dyes were singled out arson was blatantly obvious The failure to rouse mass passions on communal basis was reflected in decline in the number of communal incidents against 321 in 1971 there were 240 incidents in 1972 242 in 1973 248 in 1974 205 in 1975 169 in 1976 189 in 1977 230 in 1978 But in the last four years the pattern has changed once again and this is reflected both in rise in the number of communal incidents 304 in 1979 427 in 1980. and 319 in 1980Darid the number of deaths from 70 in 1972 -to 261 in 1979 315 in 1980 and 196 in 1981# From short-lived explosions communal riots have now turned into sputtering fuses In Hyderabad last year 25 persons were killed over eight days while in Meerut even in the first phase of violence only 18 people were killed over 14 days In Baroda 60 people have been killed over the period of 15 months In fact the Baroda riots highlight another feature namely that such violence is becoming endemic in more and more cities Moradabad for instance has been going in and out of curfews ever since. the Id police firings of 1980 In all these recent instances the pattern has been disturbingly similar Murder and arson are systematic history-run manner against tiny victims by individuals or gangs of what are invariably described as youths This is new type of violence that aims at creating and maintaining tension and is backed either by powerful political or economic groups The perpetrators are the lumpen proletariat of the cities the growing number of rootless unemployed young men whom every government has learned to dread These constitute floating army or mercenaries ready to do the bidding of those who pay them Much of the ineffectiveness of the police its consequent frustration and finally its excessive use of force result from the fact that it does not know how to cope with motiveless murder ed by faceless people And this helplessness is the tar get as in Baroda now of attacks and recrimination by both the Hindus and the Muslims The conclusion is inescapable Todays communal conflict is anything but communal On the contrary much of it is an integral part of the sharpening political conflict in the country The contenders may be the RSS and the Jamaat-i-Islami or the BJP and the CPM But it can as easily be two factions of the same party as seems to be the case in Baroda Can such violence really be dissociated from the CPM-BJP cadre killings in Kerala CPedngfessO cadre murders in Bengal and the induction of dacoits and musclemen into party cadres throughout northern India This so-called communal violence is also motivated by the desire for economic gain The number of instances has multiplied as economic conflict itself has sharpened And once again it is naive if not unprincipled to describe this kind of conflict as truly communal or to read in it1 evidence of wholesale Hindu animosity against the Muslims For one thing it is not only the Muslims who have suffered from such planned violence although they have certainly suffered more What is more important such Violence is typical of early capital, which entire classes and occupation groups find themselves threatened by economic change and resist it tooth and nail Economic Conflict It is too often forgotten that although the Muslims outnumber the Harijans in this country the number of atrocities perpetrated on the later far exceeds anything that the Muslims have suffered The reason is once again to be found in economic Conflict this time between those small and marginal farmers who need cheap or even unpaid labour to maintain the viability of their farms and landless workers demanding higher wages in line with laws or with the rising wage rate on the larger modern farms in fact to label such class conflict as caste conflict is to do as great disservice to the nation as to raise the communal bogey every time there is right between Hindu no matter of what caste and Muslim be he Shw Sunni Bohra or Ismailla To say all this is no to deny that there is residual distrust between the two communities but only to deny that it is rising once again in tides of Hindi and Islamic fundamentalism The truth is that the Muslims like any other community in the country will be able to hold their own in the sharpening political and economic race only if they acquire greater education and shed their ghetto mentality point made recently by Mr Khurshid Alam Khan aided Mr Syed Hamid vice-chancellor of Ahgarh Muslim University and if they use their undoubted political clout in several score parliamentary and hundreds of vidhan jabha Constituencies where they are sizable minority to legislators and parties who will be sensitive to their needs While they have been doing the second with considerable skill over the last three decades much like the Irish in the British Parliament of the late 19th century they have yet to do the first Leaders who keep reminding them 2j that they are an insecure minority with the dice loaded against them from the start are atv585defeatists and at worst opportunists
