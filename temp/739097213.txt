Hyderabad Riots They Are The Blame9 petty quarrel between paan walla and customer recently flared up into an ugly communal clash in Hyderabad ANEES JUNG visits the scenes of devastation in the city to find out why frenzied acts of destruction took place and each community accuses the other THE AFTERMATH The deserted mosque left and the home of Hindu which has been razed to the ground Pictures author ACROSS the river Musi is1 old Hyderabad which has begun to look these days like ghost town Sabzi Mandi is deserted The police presence is heavy and safe The mosque is empty of people of prayers It seems as if the people have gone away never to return The shop fronts are shuttered the paan shops closed the market empty Only pigs scrounge on the decaying vegetables of weeks ago Children peep out of windows from behind mud walls see no fear in their eyes It seems as if they have not yet learnt the meaning of terror of violence or destruction Their presence speaks of life that has hid itself behind the squat silent walls follow the children meet others -clusters of women sitting on doorsteps dark-eyed silent dazed How did the trouble be gin ask one of them We were asleep they tell me in unison There was noise in the distance It began coming nearer Then there was smoke Flames We bolted our doors to protect ourselves Soon they were thumping on the doors the windows They smashed then broke all the doors dragged the men away see one broken door few then many am dragged in different directions from one little house to another The story is of broken doors of fear and of panic Most of these homes are Hindu and as they are known locally They are milkmen odd labourers and number of them are peons in the State Bank and other small government offices No one knows how the trouble began The Muslims did it they say looking in the direction of the white mosque that raises its millwards clear blue sky Leaving behind the broken doors walk out of the tight 1 lanes towards the Muslims area beyond the graveyard The graves are covered with monsoon moss There is an aura of peace here that goes only with the dead The Dargah of Sharf Chaman is deserted The old watchman locks at me tentatively and takes inside He says nothing just points finger towards two shattered filigreed windows halfburnt on the floor large metal money box with the brass lock still on broken open Joojted young man emerges from the shrine He was witness to the rampage he tells me We were four men and several women praying inside the shrine Two of the women were Hindu Suddenly we noise and saw them coming They were in hundreds and they were armed It seemed like well-planned attack We bolted the shrine doors and saw them through the slits as they burnt aid destroyed everything He takes me around the shrine the tube lights have been stolen the glass lamps smashed the prayer rugs burnt the money looted Even the peer the keeper of the shrine has gone away There is no life in the Muslim area just wreckage The people have all left their homes their doors unbolted their belongings of lifetime lying in heaps of charred rubbish In little white house with brightly painted green door old man was beaten with chappals by crowd He His wife is gasping for life in the Osmania General Hospital The old man's grey shirt hangs on nail in the wall with pack of bidis sticking out of the pocket It seems as if he has stepped out and will return In the wreckage on the floor are tattered photographs of his children and grandchildren pictures of the kaaba torn out from the frame bangles and pieces of bright green sari walk in and out of number of such homes abandoned des charred beyond recognition Who were the destroyers ask the young Muslim who takes me around The Hindus he says toneless voice To him it is natural answer The story is the same destruction loss of property and personal dignity fear animosity beThe Hindus tell it The Muslims tell it No one knows how the story began Where Why Each blames the other for that seems the only natural explanation But did you not live together in peace and as friends for years and years ask them Yes we did they say We were still friends We visited each others homes even helped each other in our businesses We have been together in this mandi for generations What happened then Why the sudden upsurge of hate Why the simmering tension They stare look baffled It all began at paan shop on Sunday evening am told young man Hindu came to the paan shop and asked for an aspirin The owner of the shop Muslim told him that he sold paan and bidi not aspirin The young customer got enraged and punched the few others standing around came to his rescue Soon it became brawl got bigger Within few hours there were hundreds of people going around wildly stones burning houses molesting women and children They were not all insiders police official tells me The Lodhas from Dhoolpet were brought iii from the outskirts They are community who make living out of boot-legging and distilling They are wild lot It was clean job was pre-planned was probably the work of well-trained goondas Even the family of prominent local police in the liquor business and indulges in such activities as told Political elements are active in this area The battle for space in the mandi the running of local businesses are tied to the political power game they tell me in hushed tones young boy throws stone at temple priest breaks an idol hired gang loots dargah The blame descends on the innocents who are too weak even to hate or protest. Those who are responsible for it get away The people do not walk around Tappachaand Sabzi Mandi notice the universality of the agony the similarity of the loss and destruction The problem here seems bigger than that of two communities who have been damaged or two faiths that are failing to co-exist The problem is deeper more complex It is one of crisis in character of rapid erosion values that for long have soldered the human spirit Newspapers report that the riottorn areas have returned to normal. But when curfew locks people behind doors can they be normal Policemen in khaki uniforms continue to litter the narrow streets like sinister bugs They raise their batons to silence fears rule out discontent Brute force enforces lull but only for brief while Politicians visit the area and churn out slogans that instil quiet the quality of drug Restlessness persists withdraw behind walls only to re-emerge when the policemen have left and the politicians have won their games and gone What Sabzi Mandi needs is neither policemen nor politicians but band of decent human beings who have vision integrity and commitment who will stay and work in the area not only when it is troubled but all the time understanding the origins of social tension liaising between the people and the government and creating an atmosphere which will reject all unhealthy elements through the strength of its own purity and energy
