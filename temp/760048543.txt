Fear still lingers in children By Hariri Swamy BOMBAY January 30 4 1 Ayr ANY riot-affected little IV children still wake up in nights shouting They are coining They are coming says Fr Paul Vaz director of social work and psychologist-in-charge of the child guidance clinic at Seva Nicketan in Byculla The healing is going to be very much more difficult than it normally is when children have persistent nightmares he adds This is because this time round the pursuers in the dreams have identifiable faces and are given communal and other qualities that are very real to the children even during their waking hours The enemy is hardly an ill-defined phantom One ninth standard student whose house was burnt down on the eve of her first examination is still sitting around in state of shock Always sincere to the pranking student she worried about the future of her academic pursuits so constantly that she had fever for several days unlike several other families though hers has not taken spontaneous decision to withdraw her from school altogether and is trying to get her back into her normal curriculum as soon as possible When teachers at the Diamond Jubilee School encouraged affected children to bring their trauma out of their systems by writing essays about their experiences one eight-year-old wrote dont know why people hate us Arent we all Gods children group of would-be helpers is going around some of the refugee camps asking if parents would like to enrol their children in boarding school at Raigad One mother who has recently seen her eldest son cut to pieces in front of her is trying to persuade her youngest child an 1 1 -year-old daughter to go away to Raigad The little one holds her mother's knees tightly crying dont want to go Ill even stop school if you like will never ask you for anything ever again Just dont send me far away where wont even know whats become of you Ms Farida Lambay of the Nirmala Niketan College of Social Work who has worked with municipal school-children for well over 20 years says With all ones years of work in teaching and having learnt to be objective and all that it is difficult to stay dry-eyed when one comes across such scenes always happens in such cases it is the children who are the worst affected in variety of ways ranging from immediate physical loss to emotional and mental trauma that could have long-term reaction for example very little children cannot come the distinction their parents are able to make between identifiable friends of particular communities whom they know as being good and the other faceless bad majority of the same targeted communities While these kids suffer because few adults have been able to help them deal with their confusion young teenagers who think they know their minds are equally vulnerable because they are wide open to manipulation by unscrupulous elements In a way it is easier to deal with the younger ones who come out and ask you questions Ms Lambay explains It is the older group that we will have to work with carefully over the long term Then there are the 14-and15year-olds who have been in lockup some still languish there for the first time in their lives In many cases they were drawn into some sort of participation in the violence even if it was only in selfdefence They in no way initiated anything but now have to deal with the nightmares of recent experiences. There will be other problems in the future several children will be forced to work to support families that have lost everything including their main wage-earners Others who have dropped out of school Now may simply go on the streets Of course by now living with their friends in refugee camps has become something of an adventure for the younger ones Most of them spend their days happily enough chasing each other round the long core of the schools and community halls where they stay But every time social worker or other outsider comes to talk to their parents they come and stand nearby listening quietly while the trauma is relieved by the adults Then all the memories come back the memories of cowering under their chairs and beds for days on end hungry and forbidden to even whimper while their fathers fought it out on the streets outside Once we have seen the food and clothing Our first priority is to see that the children are occupied constantly and well says Ms Hazel Dlima principal of Nirmala Niketan If the children cannot go back to their old schools admission has to be found in new ones Books and uniforms have to be arranged for them Many children cannot deal with going back to school without uniforms and being identified by everyone else as the ones who lost their houses
