Playing politics over children's bodies Hyderabad is going through its most barbaric communal holocaust ever ManojMitta describes the carnage and the factors which led to it HYDERABAD has repeated Itself in Hyderabad that Atoo within weeks The first time no doubt was tragedy communal violence 1 sparked off by the kar seva in Ayodhya on October 30 But the second time following the so -called satyagraha there on December 6 was far from farce Never before has Hyderabad witnessed communal violence so brutal sustained and widespread as in this second round Of violence starting on December 7 The death toll speaks for itself The figure of 130-odd murders in about a week is the highest here in such riots since the Razakar movement around independence Another unprecedented phenomenon for Hyderabad is that even women and children have been killed as result of the rivalry between the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and the Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen MIM in Hyderabad Besides the Hyderabad MP. and president of the MIM Mr Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi is also the chairman of the All-India Babri Masjid Action Committee which is spearheading the battle against the Vishwa Hindu Parishad Ayodhya issue week after Mr Advanis visit to Hyderabad the police killed gang leader Mr Mohammad Sardar in an encounter Mr Sardar had earlier killed constable in the course of land dispute with rivals gang headed by one Mr Raghunandan Saday Mr Sardars followers retaliated by going on rampage that degenerated into communal violence Twelve people were killed and about 100 injured over the following week The police had to fire in several localities to quell mob clashes When Mr Advani was arrested on October 23 the BJP workers immediately forced bandh in Hyderabad The following day they organized state-wide bandh There was more violence and the time intensified as many Muslim shopkeepers resisted the bandh calls on those two days One person was killed on October 24 two on October 26 one on October 27 four on October 28 It was against this background that the Channa Reddy government suddenly imposed 36-hour anticipatory curfew in Hyderabad on October 29 days before the kar sevaks were scheduled to storm the Ayodhya shrine But the violence persisted on the same scale despite the curfew more than SO places of worship were also damaged in and around Hyderabad As result curfew was in force in parts of Hyderabad for record three weeks The last week of November was comparatively under control but reports began to come out of discontent in the police ranks due to the free hand given to one Congress MP Mr Hashim and some MIM legislators in securing the release of arrested rioters The police also seemed to have been made scapegoat of when the commissioner Mr Gurunatha Rao was summarily transferred The tension again began to heighten as the date of the Ayodhya satyagraha approached There was liberal use of poster cassettes and inflammatory speeches from both sides Three persons were killed on December 4 and one on the satyagraha day The carnage began in the morning of December 7 forcing the government to clamp down an indefinite curfew About 20 people were killed on the first day and another 40 on the next Why did the violence suddenly acquire such intensity The president of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Mr Hanumantha Rao who was the only local leader allowed to accompany the five-member Central Congress team to survey the affected areas attributes the spurt to one particular incident in the Sabzimandi area For the first time in the 12-year history of communal strife in Hyderabad woman and child of family were attacked and killed on December 7 When their bodies were discovered it was the turning point After that it was no holds barred and all guns blazing Mr Hanumantha Rao said senior police officer corroborated this observation Another local factor is the instigation of violence by Dr Channa Reddy's detractors both within and outside the Congress party to force him out of office For instance the Chevvala Assembly constituency which witnessed extensive violence is represented and dominated by the Telugu Desam According to Hanumantha Rao so much violence could not have taken place without the support of the Telugu Desam in that area Mr Owaisi says he has personal knowledge of local Congress MLA inciting people in several. localities The MLA in question is the son of prominent Congress leader in Delhi Owaisi's primary target is of course the BJP which with its vicious campaign is spreading tremendous sense of insecurity among the Muslims He has admitted that many Muslims had taken to arms but this was purely defensive or reThe BJP members on the other hand are agitated about the indulgence shown by the Congress. administration to Muslims in the old city They have cited instances of Hindu police officers being transferred out of the old city under the alleged pressure of the MIM Highlighting the exodus of Hindus from the old city after the outbreak of the latest round of violence the BJP leaders have repeatedly demanded Presidents rule in Andhra Pradesh but curiously the leader of the opposition in the Assembly Rama Rao has made no such demand and is content to talk only of the Congress administration#s failure to control the riots and his own regimes impressive record in this regard They claim to h the peoples mandate They talk proudly of their 100-year-old history Let them have tried and expose themselves he has said cryptically His confidence is obviously based on the fact that the next chief minister given the counter-pressures within the Congress party is likely to be less stable than Dr Reddy There are several reasons for Rama Rao's success in maintaining peace To begin with he was not involved in Hyderabad politics having spent most of his earlier years in the Madras film industry This resulted in his allowing officials free hand enabling them to handle situations on merit and take preventive steps Moreover in 1986 Rama Rao held elections to the municipal corporation of Hyderabad The MIM won the elections and that gave it stake in the administration relegating its rivalry with the BJP to the background
