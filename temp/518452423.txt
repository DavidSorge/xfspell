By FERNANDES July 2 is bustling with life again after riots end all activity for almost four days this week Although most people are agreed the present round of trouble is they are apprehensive that the trouble may recur because the division between its two communities has sharpened considerably in the last two years Even minor incident is given communal twist by interested road accident and one involving State Transport bus at that is viewed communally and the vehicle set on life One detects note of helplessness about the situation as one talks to local political leaders and officials Leaders of both communities irrespective of party affiliations are being accused of vying with each other in outdoing avowedly communal organisations and fanning traditional fears and hatred. particularly among the young The present trouble is said to have been brewing under the looting that took place on November 20 last when one community took out procession demanding that one of the chapters in the eighth standard history textbook be amended The procession was peaceful despite Janata and Congress leaders trying to upstage each other in communal fervour The trouble broke out when Sunni group in the community took out its own morch and went on looting spree after it was dispersed by the police There was retaliatory looting by the other community and 16 shops of one community and four of the other were ransacked by the time the police quelled the trouble Resentment over this unequal looting is said to have sparked off the reaction last Sunday to crackers being fired near place of worship day after India won the Prudential Cup in one-day cricket 7 Both communities agree there was rejoicing by all in the town over India's victory on Saturday night One community therefor seen no reason why crackers should have been burst near place of worship during the prayers 24 hours later while the other side the over-reaction lo few crackers DEATH ROLL The police who were already massed 100 km away at N-shik moved in in strength and curfew was clamped on the town from 10 pm on Monday to 5 am the next day and again from noon on Tuesday to 11 am on Thursday Their main strategy was to avert direct confrontation between the two communities contrary to official briefing in Bombay both the collector Mr Govind Swarup and the superintendent of police Mr Puri insist that only three persons not long have been killed in the riots all in police firing One of them nine--cld girl was killed when bullet went through the wall of how Seventeen others were injured in 56 rounds of

220 people were hurt in the riots Malegaon is different from other communally-disturbed towns in that the Muslims constitute 70 per cent of the population which is put officially at 25,000. unofficially at 350000 The population figure itself is an irritant between the two communities because one side feels aggrieved at what it sees as grand design to swamp it Malegaon like Bhiwandi. survives on its powerlooms of which there are 35000 officially and double that number unofficially Traditionally it is the Hindus who have supplied the yarn and collected the finished product But now Muslims have also begun making inroads into the supply of yarn and the buying of the product This has generated new fears There are other irritants Even 1921 incidents during the Khilafat movement in which police sub-insurers burnt alive and place of worship set on fire has become live issue in the town because one side refuses to recognise the four who were hanged for it as freedomfighters The former chief minister Mr Antulay's scheme to have martyrs memorials for freedom-fighters in several towns inadvertently refuelled the controversy last year The anti-cow slaughter agitation also stoked The communal fire Thirty-six butchers were sentenced to three months imprisonment last June and cows auctioned following the efforts of the Malegaon Krishi Go Seva Samiti The butchers organised strike in protest Ultimately an agreement was hammered out in the presence of police officials with the butchers agreeing not to slaughter cows Nevertheless there was bandh in the town on the eve of the feast of one community little later The result was that another festival that has traditionally celebrated by both sides meeting to settle financial accounts was boycotted What worries officials sober elders is the growing frequency of stray incidents and the way mere pinpricks inadvertent or calculated to annoy are manipulated to whip up tension Both official and unofficial sources also pointed out that in the past 1963 1967 1975 and 1982the disturbances were over in matter of hours This is the first time that they have lasted for days Both communities consider this an ominous sign Our staff
