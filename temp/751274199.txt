Smoke on the Sabarmati Theme Song AneesJung It is the summer of 1985 The elections have just passed There has been in trial carnage and bit destroying its very validity and truth There is fire and smoke again in Ahmedabad IT was the summer of 1975 The river-bed was as brown and patched as were the banks of the Sabamiati There had been drought in Gujarat for several months but there was more. talk of it now as it was election time In the heart of the city there was large bonfire The crowds indulged brickbats the police in bursting shells group of Gujaratis was seated to well-known city restaurant indulging in talk and several-course vegetarian meal We are cool people We dont want any trouble We do our business and quietly He was Surat businessman bent over his steel Ahmedabad is the town in India tint few were caught here under MISAThe Gujarat keeps his account books meticulously It is hard to find any Latin numbers continue to pay wealth tax here It is prosperous city Also dry

villages around the city She had brought water to them looms for livelihood and ran awareness of their rights when they would come with their problems to her to the city her neighbours would their visits They would taunt them and harass them in ways They even poisoned her sons cat So she decided to go on test and seek Justice Anger In The Heart Her demand was that the government should intervene take action against the neighbours and appoint police cell to safeguard the harijans But the government was busy In pollin day1 The reasons for her fast were of little consequence and the death of pet cat less so There were riots in the city There was anger in her heart There was anger in her neighbour's hearts Hie only one who exhibited no anger was the old Harijan who sat beside her and stared blankly into the hot street He had walked barefoot from the village to sit beside her and lend his support It was village on the period booming city place knitted into whole by dirty unmade lanes Though none of them1 had names each claimed distinct identity There was harijan brahmin lane Mian lane harijan lane Those who lived in one lane did not eat with those who lived the next In some
