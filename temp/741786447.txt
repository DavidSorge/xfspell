Battle Against Communalism Mobilising Local Resources By ABRAHAM THE outbreak of virulent communal strife in Meerut other parts of UP and in Old Delhi is a gruesome reminder to the country in its preoccupation with constitutional arms deal and other crises that there are fundamental longstanding and even chronic malaises which require urgent attention and which is ignored in the hope that they will just go away will force themselves bloodily on the national consciousness Just over month ago Meerut was disfigured by communal conflict of the kind that occurs there perYet every time fresh bout of trouble takes place the administration is caught napping In UP Communal contention is as good as endemic notoriety scarcely relieved by the simmering dispute over the Ram Janambhumi-Babri Masjid holy site In the circumstances one would expect the state government to keep its intelligence police and paramilitary forces constantly on the alert ready to act at the merest hint of trouble at the same time successive administrations ought by now to have been able to build up network of mohalla committees and other voluntary local action groups which can keep an eye on on day-by-day basis and through swift and effective conciliation prevent trivial disputes usually the spark that ignites conflagration from getting out of hand But on none of these grounds does the present UP government or for that matter its predecessors over the years emerge with credit Otherwise communal contention would riot surface again and again now in this part of the state now in that Regular Feature. Depressingly it is not in UP alone that communal trouble has assumed near-endemic proportions Still more ominously it is becoming regular features of the rural scene Gujarat for instance can claim to be the most communally-wracked slate in the country surpassing even UP This is so even if one does not take into account the ferocious inter-caste warfare over reservations that has convulsed it again and again Since 1969 when Ahmedabad was besmirched by large-scale communal violence Gujarat major cities and towns have frequently seen recrudescence of it and over the just year or two the virus has been infecting its villages as well as increasing numbers Dhundara Savarkundla Tasra Undra Uditi are among the places most seriously affected as are Cambay Nadiad and Veraval Kheda district is now among the most notoriously communal places in Gujarat perhaps even the country In 1986 Gujarat had the odious distinction of notching up the highest number of deaths in communal violence as many as 92 in the country Nationally twice as many people died that year in communal incidents The state had 398 communal clashes in that year with Ahmedabad Baroda Bharuch Palanpur and Veraval among the major arenas of conflict This year things are no better with more than 30 incidents in the first three weeks of April alone and with May unlikely to lag behind in this disastrous tally What can be done to contain communal conflict Broadly speaking four kinds of measures can be taken The first is preventive and depends on its efficacy on the supply of accurate intelligence on the buildup of communal tension The second is the curative which seeks to apply the balm of pacification to an already inflamed situation The third is the habilitative aimed at restoring centre to lives and families suddenly rendered directionless The last is punitive where wrongdoers are quickly brought to book and given deterrent punishment On all four counts the Central and state administrators have repeatedly fallen s communal violence tends to be concentrated in some areas of the country unfortunately the list is lengthening grassroots intelligence which would see storm coming long before it bursts it virtually non-existent Local admin generally wake up only when riot is well under way On those rare instances such as at Bhiwandi in Maharashtra in the last couple of years where extraordinary security arrangements have been made to ensure that no incident occurs on sensitive religious occasions the peace has been kept But this is more the exception than the rule Punitive measures too expeditiously or effectively taken Quite often as even now in Meerut precious time is lost in mobilising the law-enforcing authorities when just that little bit of extra speed would make all the difference between minor incident and major calamity again while commissions of inquiry have been set up after almost every communal incident they have usually taken so long to complete their work and Then there could not always been made public as to negate their utility The 1980 Moradabad riot was displayed by Mr Justice Saxena of the Allahabad High Court who submitted his report three years late May 1983 Till today it has not been published The Jigarh riot commission headed by Mr Justice Verma was appointed in October 1978 and required to submit its report within four months Its term was extended again and again and in April 1980 it asked for yet another extension of at least Vh years Instead it was wound up on July 31 1980 The Desai commission was appointed by the Gujarat government. in June 1986 almost year after the Ahmedabad riots which led to some 400 deaths and the loss of crores of rupees in damaged property cases Pending Justice is not meted out to communal wrongdoers with anything like the requisite speed or severity After the Bhiwandi 1984 riots 611 cases were registered Some 31 per cent of them 185 cases came before the courts in May-June of that year Of these 1 13 61 per cent ended in acquittals and only four in convictions in January 1986 some 18 months after the event Even at that time 65 cases were pending in the 1980 Moradabad riots in which 144 people were Killed 400 cases were registered This led to 125 chargesheets with 264 cases closed after investigation for want of evidence By January 1986 six years after the event 38 cases based on the 125 chargesheets came before the courts only to be withdrawn by the government Eleven cases were then still under investigation 64 ended in acquittals and mere six in convictions How can any communal wrongdoer be deterred by such delayed and excessively lenient justice Rehabilitative and curative measures are again inadequate more often than not Cash compensation if announced jobs are promised to the relatives of victims and similar measures are taken but they are scarcely enough and often there is no follow-up action Beneath all the paraphernalia of dealing with the aftermath of communal outrage lies more fundamental question Why is coming so rampant and becoming more and more so It is usually trivial and frivolous incidents that set off the most insane bloodletting But these are only The immediate causes Without the most fertile soil compounded of prejudice ignorance and atavistic fear the seeds of communal hatred would not sprout How do we render such soil barren Banning religious processions or regulating their routes prohibiting the dissemination of inflammatory propaganda barring the entry of religious leaders known to incite their audiences with populist and provocative rhetoric are useful measures but not enough because they deal with situations that has already been created and seek only to prevent it from spilling over What is more important is to prevent such situation from coming about in the first place This is easier said than done because the roots of communal tension lie in widespread poverty chronic unemployment and underemployment mass. illiteracy and the spread of education in any meaningful sense to only the thin upper crust of the population If so many Indian cities and towns have so large an unemployed or underemployed underclass with only two evident criminal proclivities that is because of the uneven economic development over the last four decades which has seen the poorest of the poor in the villages crowding into cities and towns even while the latter have grown to unmanageable proportions For country to have millions of tonnes Of piled up and yet so many of its people malnourished undernourished or even starving now in Rajasthan Orissa Maharashtra Karnataka and other drought-affected states speak volumes for the inequity of our social arrangements Communalism is not the fruit of religious belief and practice It is the product of insecurity real or indeprivation and growing competitiveness for scarce goods and services at times when these are not growing fast enough to satisfy all claimants However more interpolicy by the state in the matter of the public observance of religious occasions would seem to be necessary to curb communalism Our adaptation of secularism to mean the active endorsement by the state of public demonstrations of religious faith has only deepened communal self-awareness and that extent encouraged communal divisiveness Peoples Role At the same time the state must go on the offensive in propagating scientific and rational beliefs The idea is not to undermine religion but to spread habit of thought leaving it to the individual to work Out where the practice of faith ends and that of reason begins As part of such more active secular policy local administrations must mobilize street and village inhabitants in volunteer committees entrusted with maintaining communal harmony anticipating trouble and warning the authorities in time This may sound idealistic but only close public involvement can guarantee that the demon of communalism is slaughtered in the alleys. and bylanes of the cities and towns as much as in the villages The government can and should help such local groups to come together but in the end it is people themselves who must take their lives in their hands
