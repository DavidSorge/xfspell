All the six dead fell to bullets from policemen trying to contain them The riot that broke out last December was an outburst of the minority community anger with the police specially the PAC few cases of Hindus killing Muslims or vice versa were and the majority of the 24 victims fell to police bullets The uncontrollable violence that engulfed the city on May 19 however seemed to have been carefully planned and politically-motivated It started with aggressive BJP stormtroopers taking out an election procession in Muslim-dominated Lakarea and hurling abuses at the community Some Muslim youths retaliated with vengeance Four persons were killed the first night The next morning the city appeared quiet though tense But rioting started again in the evening with the BJP protest meeting in Navin Market which faces the parade area heavily populated by Muslims Rioting soon spread to almost every part of the city's central business district and continued unabated till the army was asked to move in on the evening of May 21 Communal passions ran high among sections of both the communities Hindu shopkeeper was dragged out of police jeep and lynched young Muslim bride was kidnapped and brutally murdered with the exception of three persons killed in police firing all the deaths were due to stabbing closerance shooting or burning The police could not attribute any of the killings to personal motives In most cases the police did not reach the trouble spot or were too late Nobody disputes that the riots were triggered by the BJP stormtroopers brashness Senior BJP leaders conceded that they had no control over the young blood. meaning the new recruits to the Ram Rams cause drawn from the lumpen lot seeking social legitimacy in the name of religion But the BJP's opponents also played their part in whipping up trouble The BJP candidate for the Kanpur Lok Sabha seat Ms Tasleem Ashraf was mobbed and assaulted by members of her own community on the first day Not to be left out the CPM outgoing MP Ms Subhashini Ali lost no time in claiming that she was the real victim of the BJP hooligans and pointed to partially burnt CPM office allegedly damaged by the BJP men to prove her point Today the city of Maulana Hasrat Mohani Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi which kept aloof even during the post-partition communal savagery appears almost totally polarised along communal lines Not even in 1931 when the late Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi was killed did passions run so high and suspicion was so deep-rooted The politicians have divided the people of Kanpur says Dr Awasthi an eminent historian at Kanpur University century ago. when the first riots broke out here on April 1 1890 to protest against the imposition of quarantine regulations by the British Kokila Kumhar Hindu and Akram Itahi Muslims were hanged from the same tree The second major riots in Kanpur in August 1913 were also directed against the British government The Khilafat-Congress alliance of the 20 cemented communal ties The two communities started drifting apart when Hindu revivalist or like the Arya Samaj with its stress on conversion and sangathan organisation the Hindu Mahasabha Katha Mandal and Mahabir Dal became active The Muslims reacted by forming original Tabligh-ul-Islam Anjuman-Hifazat-ul-Islam and Tanzcem committees The 1931 riots in which 400 people including Vidyarthi were killed represented the bitter harvest of this crop The events of the last two years the emergence of the VHP and the Bajrang Dal on the one hand and the Babri-Masjid action committee and other Muslim militant organisations on the other reveal replay of the 30s With the BJP ready to respond to Mr Advanis call to go all out for the kill the stakes this time are higher comparative analysis of Kanpur last three communal riots gives hint of the dangers ahead The April 1990 riots were confined to four-sq km area involving no direct assault by one community against members of the other Political activity was restrained The December 1990 riots were widespread The epicentre of the trouble however was in BeconganjChamanganj localities The riots were not provoked by any political party though politicians had lots to shout at each other during and after the riots The riots this month had distinct political origin All parties from the BJP to the CPM went out of their way to get mileage and the violence was spread over 36-sq km area as the police stood and watched helplessly.
