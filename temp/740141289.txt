Political storm brewing in Gujarat By ASHRAF SAVED The Times of India News Service 1NAGAR Dec 17 THE Chimanhai Patel ministry appears to have weathered hurricane that virtually engulfed the entire stale in the form of communal holocaust but now he will have to get ready for political bout with the BJP win the dismissal of the BJPruled governments of Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh the situation in the state has once again become surcharged with political over-tones The BJP has already started flexing muscles with threat to take issues to the street for direct confrontation with the Patel ministry It is difficult to fathom what kind of course the BJP will adopt in the near future but it is apparent that it will give testing time to the state administration which is reeling. under tremendous pressure due to the large-scale deaths and destruction of strategist Mr Patel is apt in tackling political crises and at times he has even boasted of handling them to his But this time he will have to operate under tremendous pressure Already he is shaken because the intensity of violence was beyond anybodys expectations Fortunately for him the crisis was not of his making and at the most he can be faulted for failing to assess the repercussions of the Ayodhya incident to be felt in this communally sensitive state On the earlier two occasions when communal carnages took place in 1990 in the wake of Advanis rath yatra the BJP was perceived to be responsible for triggering off the country-wide riots and on both occasions the chief minister managed to But this time much damage has been caused to the psyche of the people and their property Ironically both the communities feel let down by the Congress regimes at the Centre and in Gujarat because of the handling of the Ayodhya issue as well as communal riots in the state Politically the Patel ministry may have to pay heavy penalty in coming months when the elections are municipal corporations and panwill be held in the state Though the fury of communal riots has subsided political storm is still brewing with the BJP making its intention clear to corner the Patel ministry only advantage the chief minister has is that he has become victim of circumstances unlike the Prime Minister Mr Narasimha Rao who is alleged to have committed blunder by trusting the BJP on the other hand Mr Patel has been fighting relentless battle against the BJP from the day he parted company with it when coalition ministry collapsed in October 1990 So politically he is on strong footings but he cannot shrug off his responsibilities from the recent happenings Cold statistics cannot convey the bone chilling events that over-took the administration and the police which were virtually found sleeping particularly in Surat If one is to go strictly by the official figures as many as 109 people have been roasted alive maximum of them in Surat and its surrounding areas of the total estimated deaths of 275 Of the total 600-odd people injured nearly 1,500 have sustained bullet injuries in police firings alone Despite the deployment of the entire police force having strength of 80000 plus 30,000 home guards and summoning of seven companies and the army taking position in Ahmedabad Surat Sidhpur Palanpur Mehsana and even in Baroda curfew had to be imposed in 30 cities and towns of the state at one stage when riots were at the peak On the economy front the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry has estimated trade business and industrial losses at Rs 6150 just figure surpassing the damages caused by the five-month-long casteist and communal riots in 1985 when the Madhavsinh Solanki ministry had to bow out of office The epicentre of violence this time was Surat where hooligans not only enacted the death dance but virtually caused an earth-quake by systemdeflating destroying and burning thousands of industrial units shops and houses Trade business industrial other losses there may be mind-boggling but even at conservative estimate it can safely be put at Rs 225 crores But even worse is that it has shattered the social fabric created wide gulf between different communities and planted the seeds of anarchy in this city Sander citizens are still searching their memories to recall such holocaust in the past Fortunately the worst is over From death and destruction there is no long way to salvation reconstruction and rejuvenating the industrial and commercial empire The government will be judged not in terms of advancing monetary help but how fast it can rehabilitate the affected people and businessmen Last but not the least the citizens of this capital township deserve kudos for maintaining communal harmony Mercifully Gandhinagar named after. Mahatma Gandhi has remained an island of peace surrounded by many trouble spots.
