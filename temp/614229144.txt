Whoever thought it could happen here by Harini Swamy AS the city slowly returns to normalcy after three-and-a-half days of near anarchy statement commonly heard in private conversations. never have imagined that something like this could happen in Romhav With an official death toll of 1 45 and unofficial figures placing it above 200 the situation cannot be compared to that of any riot in Greater Bombay communal or otherwise since the partition Some old-timers suggest that even in KM7 the rioting was not as widespread or vicious as it has been this week The incidents of communal rioting which spread outwards from Bhiwandi where around 200 lives were lost in 1984 claimed 5# lives in Thane and 87 in Bombay But the rioting then though spread over 10 days was localised and public transport services were unaffected except in the specific areas where the Shiv Sena chose to impose bandhs In 1970 when the first major Bhiwandi riots look place and the ensuing frenzy was concentrated in the heart of the textile town at least 125 lives were lost in less than four days But the nearby Bombay had been marginal The anti-south Indian violence instigated by the Sena in the late 60s too subsided after most of the city's residents ignored the saining efforts to burn down Udipi hotels Unlike earlier times of national unrest there was one direct link between the state and Ayodhya substantial contingent of kar originated from Maharashtra The two Indo-Pakistan wars had no direct repercussions in Bombay Similarly there was no perceptible anti-Sikh activity in the city after Mrs Indira Gandhi death in 1984 At the height of worldwide protests against the publication of Salman Rushdies Satanic Verses there was only one ugly incident in Bombay in which the police shot a group of marchers who had planned to hand protest memorandum over to the British Council authorities killing 11 and injuring 25 seriously There were no counterreactions 1 the city has not been totally free of incidents with communal overtones Yet in each instance the local population has appeared to be reluctant to take up arms and has reportedly been actively goaded by political or other interest groups before it has reacted Even then residents of the worst-affected areas have often been quoted as saying that it was outsiders who started the destruction and that the police apparently wanting to settle old scores ended up causing the most extensive damage The most extreme expression of frustration in the lower ranks of the police was during the police riots in 1982 As Mr Asghar Ali Engineer points out in his essay Ten Days That Shook Bombay and Bhiwandi religion is not the cause but an instrumental factor used by unscrupulous elements who play on people inbuilt prejudices to whip up frenzy For example reports of 1 929 riot state that textile strike was engineered during April-October 1 928 by communist union in Bombay After that strike was called off there was an oil Industry strike in December the same year aimed at crippling the mills once again The oil companies tried to continue working by bringing in sturdy Pathans who would not be intimidated by the strikers Members of the Girni Kamgar Union later renamed as the Red Flag Union suggested repeatedly at public meetings that the Muslim Pathans were kidnapping the children of mill-workers while the government and the police did nothing to dispel the rumours communal hatred was built up until it finally resulted in violence in February 1929 at Bhiwandi in 1984 to the apparent cause of the riots Shiv Jayanti procession on March 3 during which some marchers apparently shouted offensive slogans preceded the outbreak of the riots by full fortnight during this time the Sena as well as couple of reactionary Urdu publications did their best to fan communal passions When the areas residents still refused to react truckloads of outsiders who had no fellow feeling with they were ferried in One of the first riots at Majaswadi in Jogeshwari was apparently engineered over period of several months at the behest of developers named Baptista whose agents pitted local Muslims and Hindus against each other by encouraging them both to build shrines on the same plot of land while they left an adjoining plot free for his use. Three were killed and 200 rendered homeless in the bloodbath Subsequently leaders from both communities decided to give up their claims on the land leaving it as the children's playground it was originally intended to be But since then several sections of hutments in Jogeshwari have been stirred into violence from time to time and lives have been lost in the process.
