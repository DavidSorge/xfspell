ESCAPES CARNAGE ESCAPES CARNAGE Economic compulsions came first by Anand Agashe The Times of India News Science Dist Nashik December 12 BUT for the flourishing powerloom industry in the consensitive Malegaon the ost-Ayodhya violence last week could easily have taken much heavier toll of this under developed town in north Maharashtra Four people died and were injured including 20 policemen series of communal flare-ups on December 7 and 8 before the police clamped down curfew and assumed total control of potential situation However while the local administration deserves credit for the swiftness of its stern measures the roots of the relatively low-key violence here definitely lie in the economics of the Hindu and Muslim communities Nearly week after Ayodhya the Malegaon Muslims continue to be visibly agitated lot Equally forceful retributions in the country and abroad have also angered the local Hindus Yet both the communities were present the unpictured of caged adversaries who are willing to strike but unwilling to wound at least fatally Both the communities stand to lose heavily if they persist with arson and assault for too long observes the local Rashtriya. Swayamsevak Sangh RSS second trader Mr Suryanarayan Kabra No provocations will be able to the basically strong bond linking the two communities concurs the local Janata Dal MLA Mr Nihal Ahmed who has vowed not to take of the black band on his arm till the Babri Masjid is rebuilt Malegaon is one of the few places in the country where Hindus are in minority Over 70 per cent of Malegaons 575 lakh population are Muslims and an overwhelming majority of their own powerlooms There are an estimated 75000 powerlooms which keep engaged practically all members in the productive age-group of Muslims households sizeable section of the Hindus are traders who have traditionally close business links with the loom holders The supply of raw material and purchase of finished goods from the loom owners is primarily in the hands of the Hindus Youths from many Hindu families in and around Malegaon are employed by loomholders traders and in some of the powerloom ancillaries Thus virtually the entire town subsists mainly on the powerloom industry the daily turnover being around 1 crore rupees There are two sugar factories Girna Cooperative and Ravalgaon in the region But the absence of any other major industry in the neighbourhood has further enhanced Malegaons reliance on the local power-looms We simply cannot afford to the looms non-functional for long confess even the chauvinists from both communities The 75-year old Mr Jayanarayan Sharma is die-hard socialist and journalist who is born and brought up in Malegaon He is among those who feel that Malegaon would always be melting pot where communal tensions would neither stop simmering nor boil over to assume disastrous proportions The communal contours of local politics according to him have become increasingly sharper during the past. decade As result though we have never had orioting as such sporadic assaults and killings have always occurred whenever there is local external provocation he observes Demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya last Sunday has clearly lightened the needs of the unavoidable co-exof Malegaons Muslims and Hindus Whatever the comof daily bread and butter deep suspicion and hatred now appears to have become the predominant character of their mutual bond This came into sharp focus last week There are an estimated 120plus mosques in Malegaon large number of which have reportedly proliferated overnight along the roads as temples do in predominantly cities.
