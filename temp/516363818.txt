BOMBAY RIOTS BOMBAY RIOTS US press paints dismal picture By GAUTAM ADHIKARI The Times of India News Service WASHINGTON February 4 INDIAS particularly Bombays image continues to take beating abroad in the wake of the violence that has plagued the nation since December 6 At times it could make outsiders wonder whether India remained functioning democracy This morning The New York Times major shaper

One continues inside gives extracts from transcripts of police radio conversations recorded when the riots were on which Indian newspapers have not carried for fear of inflaming passions further The extracted portions include obscene references to Muslims and suggest that in many instances the police did not intervene in time to stop arson or rioting because the victims happened to be Muslims The report alleges that in one conversation between the control room and police contingent in Dongri the policemen on the spot were ordered by the control room not to allow army trucks to distribute. milk to Muslims whose huts had been burned down In another instance the control room using obscenities seems to have asked its forces to let Muslim-owned garage burn Only property owned Maharashtrians

break out in any country but the law and order enforcers of the state are normally expected to act against all lawbreakers and appear as the protector of life and property of all. citizens In Bombay according to this report the police allegedly co-operated with the Shiv Sena rioters by selective non-intervention and even by active participation in arson against Muslims in some cases Much of Bombays gloom wrote Mr Gargan comes from the inaction of the government Neither the chief minister of Maharashtra state Mr Sudhakarrao Naik nor the Indian Prime Minister Mr Narasimha Rao reacted to the violence as it consumed the city In the eyes of many people in Bombay Mr Rao has been indifferent to the problem The report quotes participant at meeting Bombay's leading citizens had with Mr Rao He just sat there He just said yes yes and then we were led out This report comes in the wake of series of dismal pictures of India in major media outlets in the United States Sundays ago the

influential daily published pessimistic reports on prospects of continuing economic liberalisation in India after Ayodhya although editorially the journal was hopeful that India would pull through And the prospect of BJP-ruled India being very much better as many non-resident Indians here believe was open to question after report in The New York Times on January 24 quoted BJP. leaders on development economic growth and nuclear issues Mr Malkani BJP vice president and spokesman was quoted as s35aying that education was not really relevant to the Indian conditions In his view farmer

India if the BJP came to power Foreign companies can come in if they bring technology and capital only in those areas we do not have technology Mr Dubashi said leading to speculation here in circles interested in India about how such policy would be different from the one followed earlier by the Congress party for decades and whether the BJP was against the world trend towards economic globalisation In IMF-World Bank circles in this town there is considerable nervousness even though cautious optimism remains on India Officials of Indian origin in the Fund and the Bank naturally anxious about their homeland and try to pick up as much information as they can from people returning from visits to South Asia in general however and especially in the India departments at the two or three is wait and watch attitude which is not quite ready to write off Indias prospects just yet In the standard and poor country credit ratings India remains stuck at minus It has not slid any further now has it climbed for the last few months Fund-Bank experts say all is not lost for the economy if Indian politics can be calmed down But that precisely may be problem for the medium term There are two aspects to the reforms explained an expert on India's economy declining to be quoted by name One action and the other is structural reform Stabilisation has made considerable progress as the coming budget is expected to reflect But in the current political situation further reforms may not be implemented unless the government shows some determination inflation was under control and the budget deficit for the current year was expected to remain on target The Reserve Bank of India's projection of four per cent growth for the economy this year may be bit too optimistic said the expert but he considered three or even 35 per cent rate feasible demand recession was on but although industry had suffered agricultural and agriculture-related sectors of the economy had done quite well The question was whether the government would have the nerve or the time to go ahead with the important reforms that were still to be implemented Further financing under the extended finance. facility of the IMF for instance would depend on both stabilisation measures and the progress of reforms But the current political situation may severely handicap the governments efforts Many of the reforms as recommended by the Narasimham Committee for the financial sector and the Chelliah Committee on fiscal policy could still be implemented by the government with relative ease because they would not involve politics directly Problems might arise over further efforts to privatise loss-making public units or establish an exit policy for sick industries But other reforms could still be carried out the expert said While the confidence of external investors has been shaken India's economy could still rebound one year or two to dispel its faltering image It was India's politics that was the problem with many people wondering what lay ahead for the nation.
