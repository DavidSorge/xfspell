Facing Facts In Kashmir By INDER MALHOTRA PERHAPS inevitably General Zia-ul-Haq's death has overshadowed great many developments of importance in and around this country even so it is time that the rather gory goings-on in Kashmir recently paid the attention they deserve For they underscore the potential for mischief in the sensitive border state which is seldom free from pressures of diverse kinds from across the line of control What has been happening also advertises the failure over the years of successive governments in both New Delhi and Srinagar to perform the delicate task. of both preserving Kashmir identity Kashmiris call ii and integrating it in the wider Indian family There is no use shutting ones eyes to the continuing presence in the happy valley of hard-core of proPakistani elements after all these years But this is the least of the problem It was containable even when the towering Sheikh Abdullah was on the side of those screaming for plebiscite and surely it should be easier to contain it today But that ought not to be cause for comConvenient Cover On the contrary it should be source of some concern that the existence and activities of professionals pro-Pakistanis in Kashmir have become convenient coyer for the nefarious designs and doings of anyone and everyone who thinks he has grievances against either Srinagar or New Delhi or both Waving Pakistani flags and shouting pro-Pakistani slogans especially at televised Cricket tests get such elements much greater national and international attention than mere burning of few buildings or even bridges would do Honesto-goodness criminals and crooks find this situation to their advantage In other words the fact has to be faced that instead of decreasing over the years the number of those wilting and anxious to resort to the proPakistani strategies at the drop of Kashmiri skull-cap seems to have increased the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Kashmiri's neighbourhood as well as within it has doubtless contributed to this situation But it should be noted that not all Kashmiri fundamentalists are either pro-Pakistanis or secessionists The split in the Muslim United Front statements by Qazi Nissar speak for themselves What appears to have encouraged anti-national hoodlums no less are political bungling and stark administrative ineptitude Even cursory looks at what has gone on is sufficient to establish the pernicious pattern in April to go back no farther than that ugly violence broke out in Srinagar and spread elsewhere as soon as the super-secret Ojheri ammunition dump in Pakistan blew up raining death and destruction on the twin-cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Ironically some scallywags in Srinagar blandly blamed India for the catastrophic. explosion although the truth as established by Mr Junejo who later had to pay the price for it was that the calamity was caused by the crass callousness of the Pakistani military pampered organisation the Inter-Services Intelligence The more recent mourning for Gen Zia has been as spurious and simulated as the breast-beating over Ojheri It is not merely that some of those who enacted death dance in the name of grieving for the departed General had 1 1 years earlier gone on rampage for different reasons the execution of Mr Bhutto by Gen Zia whose portraits they had then burnt So great was their rage against Mr Bhuttos judicial murder that they even burnt beautiful church merely because the hangman employed by Mr Bhuttos executioner Tara Masih was Christian It is equally noteworthy that mischief-makers in Srinagar had been busy in their favourite pastime of burning and looting and attacking the police since four days before Gen Zia's transport aircraft plummeted from the sky Their ploy in earlier days was an apparently strong craving on their part to celebrate Pakistan's Independence day Obviously neither these celebrations nor the subsequent mourning could have gone on indefinitely That is where the traditional Shia-Sunni schism inflamed to an unusual degree by the refusal of some Pakistani Shias to hide their relief over Gen Zias death came in handy to habitual trouble-makers in Kashmir capital In between April and August also parts of Srinagar had gone up in flames ostensibly in protest against an increase in electricity charges and the state governments wicked resolve to recover the arrears of sales tax However the protesters thought that the greatest shield against unwanted imports was the slogan Pakistan Zindabad Pro-Pak Slogan remarkable feature of the chain of engineered disturbances in Kashmir is often the trouble has remained confined to certain lodeep in the interior of Srinagar and even when it has spread elsewhere the storm-centre of the mischief has been the self-same area of the city and it is not fortuitous that these turbulent pockets are the traditional strongholds of Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq of the Awarrii Action Committee To explore how he and his followers have suddenly acquired capacity conspicuous by its sheer absence in the past to hold the state government to ransom it to run into sordid story of political mismanagement all along the line Maulvi Farooq belongs to the family of Mirwaiz Yusuf Shah Sheikh Abdullah's arch-enemy since as far back as 50 years ago In Kashmiri folklore the classic conflict between the two sides is known as the Sher-Bakra fight deriving this colourful nickname from the fact that the Sheikh was Sher-e-Kashmir and men in the Mirwaiz family always sported goatee beards It was left to Dr Farooq Abdullah to reverse this history of half century cynically to make common cause with his namesake and thus confer on Maulvi Farooq and the Awami Action Committee the legitimacy had lacked for close to 1 four decades Dr Abdullah's explanation may be that after the Congress was foolish enough to drive him to the wall and indeed to topple him in 1984 through particularly shabby political manoeuvre he was bound to look for support wherever he could find it Now being at the receiving end of Maulvi Farooqs antics he must know how shortsighted and self-defeating his strategy was In any case after Dr Farooq Abdullah's dismissal in July 1984 and his replacement by his brother-in-law Mr GM Shah two-year black period began in Kashmir Followers of both the Farooqs played the pro- Pakistani card for all it was worth And no one encouraged the anti-national and undesirable elements more than the new chief minister who was allowed to behave as some kind of Shah of Kashmir by the time the Union government woke up sacked Mr GM Shah and imposed governors rule an option that was available to it when it decided to get rid of Dr Abdullahenormous damage had been done The Central government and the Congress leadership egged on obviously by the local Congressmen squirming in the torment of having been out of office for ten years then compounded their earlier mistake of unremitting opposition to the National Conference and Dr Farooq Abduljah by going to the other extreme In the assembly elections in March 1987 they insisted on Conference-Congress alliance and sharing of power by the two parties This has had several disastrous consequences It has become easier for Dr Abdullah's opponents to decry him as New Delhi agent and thus betrayer of Kashmir's autonomy and Both the mainstream parties wedded to national secularism having got into the government where the performance of both is pathetically ineffective# the rest of the political arena has been left open t extremist and fundamentalist elements Maulvi Farooq's frustration and concomitant irresponsibility constitute the other side of the coin In fairness to him it must be added that he is not bothered about Pakistan or any ideology or ideals He is angry because the abrupt end of his cosy relationship with the Farooq has deprived him of position which was both privileged and profitable Silence In Delhi to bemoan deterioration of the Kashmir administration perhaps even more than that in other states would be to stress the obvious However someone must answer two questions First why had pro- Pakistani demonstrations stopped during the Governors Rule Secondly who is going to do something to tone up the Kashmir administration and when perhaps the most alarming part of the shocking and shameful events in Kashmir is that no one in Srinagar or even Delhi has condemned them The Kashmir assembly passed resolution condoling Gen Zia's death as it should have But wasnt it its duty also to deplore those who had tried to create chaos and mayhem on the pretext of mourning dim The silence in Delhi is even more intriguing especially in view of Congress MPs penchant to issue statements on all kinds of irrelevant subjects.
