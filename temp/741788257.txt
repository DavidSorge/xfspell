riots vent for anti-India feelings By ZAIDI The Times of India News Serbia SRINAGAR August22 VBStRviiKS acre are V-lover the senseless violence that erupted in the Kashmir valley following the death of Gen Zia particularly when the Pakistanis themselves did not take to violence and mourned the death gracefully Yet it has to be understood that for the residents of this sensitive bordering state it was yet another occasion to give vent to their anti-India and more specifically pro-Pakistani feelings It is also not ironic that people have laid down their lives for person whom they had cursed for executing Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto only decade last nine persons were lolled in disturbances in the Kashmir valley following the hanging of Mr Bhutto on April 4 1979 For some Kashmiris Gen Zia had years emerged as leader for the same reason that Mr Bhutto was held in high esteem Mr Bhutto was the first Pakistani leader to declare 1000-year war on India Moreover if it was. Mr Bhutto who gave the idea of manufacturing an Islamic bomb Gen Zia actually managed to acquire nuclear capability clandestinely through and put Pakistan on par with India as far as acquisition of nudear was concerned Even after 40 years since partition large chunk of the Kashmiri people has not accepted the state's accession to India Whether it is cricket match between India and Pakistan or explosions at an ammunition dump near Islamabad any excuse is good enough for the pro-Pakistani elements in Kashmir to start trouble in the valley This time the reaction was particularly intense The situation was already explosive before the news of Gen Zia's death reached Srinagar after lapse of several years this year on Pakistan's Independence Day August 14# some people chose to display jubilation and hoisted the Pakistan national flag This was apparently done at the behest of some political adversaries of Dr Farooq Abdullah While August 14 passed off peaceful violence broke out the following day India's Independence Day when the police prevented some pro-Pakistanis from hoisting black flags The person was killed in clashes with the police Thus the news of Gen Zias death came at time when the trouble seemed to be dying out and in the situation to such an extent that disturbances broke out throughout the valley apart from the business establishments the religious places and The residential minority community in the target of the attack by the mob was also the late Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah who had an unquestionable sway over the sentiments of the Kashmiri Muslims in his lifetime The late Sheikhs ancestral house at Soura on the outskirts of the city was stoned by angry demonstrators immediately after news of Gen Zias death spread Portraits of Sheikh Abdullah besides those of the Prime Minister Mr Rajiv Gandhi and Dr Farooq Abdullah were also burnt at some places This anger against the Sheikh was perhaps due to the fact that large number of Kashmiris felt betrayed when he entered into an agreement with the then Prime Minister Mrs Indira Gandhi in 1975 That agreement dosed the issue of Kashmir's accession to India but lot of people have not taken it well The dwindling popularity of Dr Farooq Abdullah's government appears to have made matters worse Di Abdullah was brought to power with an overwhelming mandate in the 1983 elections Eyeja when he was dismissed by the Centre after year or so he was held in high esteem in the valley He enjoyed popular support in his fight with the Centre the next year However 4he Farooq-Rajiv accord in 1986 marked The decline of Di Abdullah's popularity He subsequently formed government in alliance with the Congress That the dissidence in the National Conference is no secret is dear from the fact that its membe of from Srinagar Mr Rashid Kabuli and some others do not spare any opportunity to criticise the government Perhaps more popular government would have been in position to deal with the recent dis Army Jawans patrolling curfew-bound Srinagar on Friday UNI photo
