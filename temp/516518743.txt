By NEW DELHI August 20 confrontation between the Muslims and the police which led to ugly riots that ruined the spirit of two joyous occasions Id and Independence Day is not new to Delhi by any means. similar event in 1975 had ended in bigger disaster lot more people were killed and much greater property destroyed than on the black Friday last week It is also remarkable that the more behind the Two tragedies were different The event pattern of strife and violence were strikingly The 1975 incident was triggered by purely local factors It was indeed direct outcome of running battle between two factions of the Muslim community The Shahi Imam Syed Abdullah Bukhari was then enmeshed with the advisory committee of the waqf board over several issues including the control of the income from the Jama Masjid What began as verbal warfare between the Shahi Imam and the then minister for VJr Shah Nawaz Khan ended in bloody battle between the police and the Muslims The supporters of the Imam marched to BaKa Ghar in Daryaganj where the advisory committee was holding its meeting The police had to resort to firing according to the then lieut -governor the late Mr Krishna Chand because there was threat to the life of Mr Shah Nawas Khan Mr Burney now the Union home secretary was the secretary of the advisory committee at that time Luckily the Delhi administration dealt with the present eruption with greater degree of sophistication than it had done five years ago which shows that it has learnt some lessons from past experience Whereas in 1975 there was hue and cry over the use of excessive force by the police and judicial inquiry was demanded this time the authorities are being criticised for inaction. Ostensibly the black Friday was part of chain reaction to the events in Moradabad In that sense to quote the lieut -governor Mr Jagmohan there was no local reason for the clash between the minority community and the police There is one more common feature between the two. occurrencesthe role and behaviour of the Jana Sangh now the Bharatiya Janata Party As in 1975 so now it has tried to stay away from the arena of conflict In fact RSS volunteers were reportedly given specific directives five years ago not to go anywhere near the ed spots This time the leaders of the BJP notably Mr Malhotra and Mr Sahani have been keen on underlining that the majority of the Muslims were not in favour of showing disrespect to the national flag unfurled in various localities by different leaders on Independence Day They have quoted two instances of the flags after being removed by some young Muslim ruffians were ed by elderly and responsible Muslims and returned to their counterparts in the majority community CHARGE According to the two BJP leaders the whole trouble was fomented by handful of goods protected by the Congress leaders who had earlier found these toughs useful during the elections Mr Sahani has gone so far as to assert that if some people wanted to observe black day it was their democratic right to do so All that the police were required to do was total against the goondas known to them as to else All this has not prevented political leaders of the capital professing to be from blaming the RSS for its complicity in the riots These leaders hold the Jamaat-e-Islami equally culpable for what has happened The call for observing black Friday was given by the Indian Union Muslim League which was in the forefront of trouble on the previous occasion also Its volunteers were openly distributing black arm bands in the Jama Masjid area The whole thing was really like rerun of bad film especially because Mrs Gandhi and her party continued to be the target of the trouble-makers as they were in 1955 Foreign involvement in the riots touched off by Mbradabad has been talked of extensively and underscored by the BJP leaders like Mr Vajpayee and Mr Advani more by innuendo than directly Mr Malhotra has been hinting at the possibility of 1947. being repeated The Jamaat-e-Islami is being accused of providing the muscle to the Muslim community's protest against the Moradabad incident particularly in Delhi which is the headquarters of its Amir Maulana Mohammad Yusuf The Union Muslim League which organised the black Friday enjoys the Jamaats support DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES The Jamaat has five chapters in the sub-continent Two in India and one. each in Pakistan Bangladesh and Sn Lanka Significantly it has separate Kashmir chapter The two chapters apparently follow In Kashmir the Jamaat seeks to capture political power and therefore contests elections In the rest of India it has no known political objective It calls itself cultural organisation But there is no love lost between it and Mrs Indira Gandhi According to its critics the Jamaat. in Delhi seeks to create disaffection against her among the Muslims At least one Congress leader Mr Goel insists that if any one stands to gain from the present strife it is the Jamaat and its spiritual brethren RSS with whom it has secret political understanding The BJP leaders point out that incidents of arson and rioting could have been prevented by the police by adequate precautions and timely action They particularly blame the police officers for having retreated from the Jama Masjid area at the first sign of trouble rather than stay firm But the DPCC chief Mr Bhagat commends the restraint with which Mr Jagmohan and the police commissioner Mr Bhinder have tackled the situation He says that by refraining from excessive use of force they deprived the miscreants of the O opportunity to escalate the conflict the latter were looking for Mr Bhagat is all praise also for the prompt action taken against those policemen who are alleged to have behaved rudely towards residents of the curfew-bound areas As it happens the Panchkuin Road incident involving stall in Imamia Hall took place well before the Moriot So did the other incident in Delhi in which eve-teasing acquired communal overtones Either of these two incidents could have started major conflagration But apparently the citizens in Delhi during the last 30 years have gained enough maturity to deal with. such sensibly It is to the credit of both the majority and minority communities that they did not allow communal tempers to run high Otherwise on the black Friday Delhi could easily have become another Moradabad And it is this that has kept the minority communitys sense of security in tact There is every reason to hope that last weeks communal conflict will soon be thing of the past Bad characters detained by the South Korean regime undergo Siard physical training in military camp in Seoul
