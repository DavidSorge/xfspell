Eminent Muslims express grief over clash outside Juma Masiid By Rekha Dixit MUMBAI Eminent members of the Muslim community in the city have expressed distress over the near the Juma Masjid on Sunday evening in which two people were stabbed to death and four other injured It is extremely disturbing that something like this had to happen during the holy month of Ramzan when even warring nations observe ceasefire said editor of an Urdu daily Haroon Rashid We hope that the issue will be amicably resolved so that there is no need to observe Id on two days President of the Anjuman-i-Islam former Maharashtra minister Ishaq Jamkhanawala said This is sordid state of affairs Muslims should not be shedding blood on such flimsy issues which could have been rightly settled by mutual consent. Dialogue The clash on Sunday occurred between members of two sects of Sunni Muslims the Deobandis and the Barelvis The relations between them have been strained of late The incident which sparked the conflict was distribution of pamphlets outside the Juma Masjid by members of the Barelvi sect The pamphlets reportedly ridiculed the method of worship adopted by the Deobandi sect According to articulate Muslims contacted by this newspaper the basic difference between the two communities is that the Deobandis consider the Prophet Mohammed as human being who was assigned the divine role preach the message of Allah The Barelvis on the other hand elevate the Prophet to much higher status and believe that he was really medium to reach God and hence somebody much more than human being Also while the Deobandis discourage any kind saint worship the Barevlis encourage such worship in the belief that God can be reached through the saints and their wishes can be fully filled Some Muslim citizens say thai the discord originally began the sighting of the new moon which marks the beginning of the Ramzan Said Mr Rashid The Rawat-i-hilal committee which is appointed by the Juma Masjid foi the sighting of the moon had ear Her announced that the period of fast began on January 1 However on January 19 resident along with two witnesses approached the committee and said he had sighted the moon day before the fasting period began The committee then resolved thai one roza had been missed and should therefore be observed This decision apparently was not welcomed by the Barelvis who felt that their viewpoint was not taken into account Tension which was already palpable triggered off the bloody clash on Sunday Some people are of the opinion that the person who sighted the moon in Bhiwandi should have approached the committee immediately and not wasted several days The committee decides the date of die Ramzan period for particular region and Muslims feel that it will be against the fundamentals of Islam for Muslims residing in the jurisdiction of the same committee to observe Islam on two separate days remember that in the late 1970s there was similar ancient sighting of the moon At that time the Muslim community took the initiative to resolve the matter and observe the extra roza after We should have adopted similar policy this time too said Mr Jamkhanawala President of the Aman Committee Wahid Ali however put the blame on the police saying that they should have been prepared for the eruption of such violence. It is not as if the violence erupted all of sudden it has been building up since the Deobandis decided to organise massive congregation at Bandra last December This pamphlet war has been going on ever since In fact we had on several occasions approached the commissioner PS Pasricha Had the police taken time then matters may not have come to such head Mr Ali said Mr Pasricha acknowledged that the delegations had approached him We were aware of the growing conflict and were trying to counsel both sides separately In 1 fact that was how it was possible to avoid any clash during the Bandra congregation But sometimes matters go out of hand despite the best measures He also pointed out that it was because of the police that the situation was under control at present Iran Engineer of the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism said There is definitely more to the incident than meets the eye The two communities have never come to war in the past Moreover feel it is significant that it has happened just before die general elections Mr Ali however said there had been similar skirmishes between the two communities in the past.
