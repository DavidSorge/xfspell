Mandir Triumphs Over Mandal In Sitamarhi By VENKATESAN II was that criminalised stale like Bihar remained not-free for more than two years till the communal volcano exploded in Sitamarhi recently. While Ihc Bihar chief minister Mr Ialoo Prasad Yadav could rightly claim credit for this achievement he should pay all the message in Sitamarhi his strategy to prevent communal was inherently vulnerable The riots were triggered when Durga puja procession insisted on taking new routes populated by Muslims some of whom had resisted the diversion Anti-social elements and local political leaders had apparently provoked Ihc violent outbreak which claimed more than 40 lives On the face of il it is tempting to add Sitamarhi to the long list of places where religious processions have caused communal conflicts Il has also been established however that religious identities became susceptible to exploitation by vested interests when there are significant local reasons for resentment. against minorities Hold Resented In Bhagalpur for instance its Muslims hold over the local silk industry was resented by some elements and this led to the riots there in 1989 claiming more than 1000 lives Similarly in Sitamarhis Riga division fiddles and hiris seem to have revolutionised the economic life of section of local Muslims Financial assistance pouring in through banks and other institutions have made them autonomous and prompted them to break with the feudal agrarian set-up Indeed the genesis of the large-scale communal violence in rural areas of the district can be traced. lo the agrarian imbalances prevailing in the region In sense the origins of the Sitamarhi riots can be traced to Mr Yadav's dubious strategy of confronting the mandir with Mandal He believed that by mobilising the OBCs on the mandal platform he will be able to resist the appeal of Hindu communalism But the participation of OBCs in the riots despite his denials has disproved this myth Indeed the riots have shown that the OBCs are not homogeneous group who can be relied upon for any political mobilisation on sustained basis Mr Yadav cannot afford to ignore this stark reality More important it shows that confronted with choice between i1 religion and caste particularly in communally-surcharged common people are likely to be influenced by the former rather than the latter This had been proved in Biharsharif earlier The poor lowcaster Hindu and Muslim labourers engaged in bidi-making were successfully organised by the CPI which held its assembly and Parliament scats when the riots rocked the town in 1981 After the riots however these labourers abandoned their class interests and began to identify themselves more vigorously with their respective communities and became more susceptible to manipulation by the elites of their communities Teamed Up Historically too as Mr Gyancandra Pandey recounts in his book The Construction of Communalism in Colonial North India the Hindu culcasters of Koeris Kurmis and Ahirs had teamed up with the upper castes of Brahmins Bhumihars and Rajputs in the agitation to end cow sacrifices in the 1890s and 1910s in Bihar Yet the latter still considered the former as untouchables In 1 9 1 0 and 1 920s when the former became better organised and increasingly militant in pressing their demands for more respectable status the latter joined with upper caste Muslim zaminders and unleashed violence against them In other words Bihars complex social set-up implies that the gains from Mandal can only be short-lived and that the antidote to comes to be found elsewhere Failure to learn this lesson will mean that Muslims who were drawn to the Janata Dal in the last elections would soon feel alienated from it Indeed the riot has made the future of the Maya pact Muslim-Yadav part nurtured by Mr Yadav uncertain In any case the pact could not bury the legacy of the 1981 Biharsharif riots which were essentially between Muslims and Yadav over the plots of Muslim cemetery lands Muslims are already dissatisfied with Mr Yadav's indifferent approach to the incomplete inquiry into the Bhagalpur riots They insist that the present inquiry be headed by three persons in view of the alleged affinity of Mr Justice RN Prasad present chairman of the inquiry committee to the BJP The inordinate delay in submitting the inquiry report will not only fail to instil confidence in the minorities but render Mr Yadav promises to bring speedy relief and justice to the recent riot victims look hollow
