This is also vital to prevent ghettostresses Majlis activist Ms Tasneem Khan who has been bailing out besieged residents of Behrampada in Bandra east in couple of ravaged slum pockets of Govandi and Mahim local relief committees have started constructing tiny pucca houses in place of the original tin and tarpaulin shanties According to Mr Iqbal Dudhwalla builder and chairman of the Agripada. Relief Committee the foundation has been laid for the construction of 100 180-sq ft houses at Sagar Rahavasi Sangh near Mahim junction which was devastated in December. We have submitted the papers to the concerned authorities and are keeping to Development Control regulations says Mr Dudhwalla who anticipates no problems from the authorities as the settlement is authorized The riot victims here are expected to raise only 10 per cent of the total house cost Rs 30000# while the government grant and contributions from condominium of relief organisations will make up the rest The condominium has identified other spots in Govandi Tulsiwadi Tardeo Saat Raasta Mahalaxmi and Chembur for reconstruction projects in Tulsiwadi where over 500 houses were destroyed or damaged members of both communities have been urged to form committee to identify largish sites in the colony where cluster of houses can be constructed The Govandi relief committee has built 42 brick-and-cement sheeted houses at cost of Rs 1 7000 each in the Kamla Raman Nagar basti of Baiganwadi where 82 houses 90 per cent belonging to the minority community were partially or fully destroyed in the December riots Of The 42 houses built three belong to Hindus The relevant papers for the reconstruction programme were submitted to the collector and BMC commissioner says Mr Mauzzam Mukkadam committee member in charge of the project The building materials were provided by the Central Relief Committee of Musafirkhana he says Unaffected Hindus of the basti who continue to live in their tacky tin shacks have welcomed the return of their Muslim neighbours and are not envious of the new houses built for them After all most of our houses stayed unscathed so why should we be jealous ask long-time resident Ms Aruna Shevade whose husband is mechanical at the naval dock in south Bombay Other social service agencies such as the SPARCombine Society for Promotion of Area Resource Centres and National Slum Dwellers Federation are also keen on upgrading the original now-missing structures to make them stronger and more secure. This school of thought holds that this would have twin benefits it would at once ameliorate sub-human living quarters and improve the cityscape We are looking at long-term solutions says Mr Jockin of the -SPARC combine which has been working on lowcost housing in slums resettlement colonies for the past decade We would like to build pucca structures with sturdy roof wherever possible in keeping with the government's building by-laws instead of having tinshanties on the site again he says But such projects would be restricted to areas where large number of houses had been destroyed he says However even those residents whose homes were not damaged during the riots would be asked if they wanted their house upgraded The idea is evidently to improve the entire settlement In fact SPARC has already initiated such projects at the Naaz Cooperative Housing Society in Govandi 18 houses 5 for Hindu families 13 for Muslims which were targeted
