Hidden hand behind riots By JAIN Fish still highly premature to conclude that there is hidden hand behind the sudden upsurge of communal trouble in the country But after the outrage in Moradabad in UP on Eid day it is no longer possible to dismiss this possibility is on me once in Morawas clearly pre-planned No one can possibly dispute it in view of the fact that some members of the congregation at the Eidgah had brought knives daggers and even fire-arms with them Since nothing had happened in recent months in the city or in the state to create sense of insecurity among the Muslims the inference must be that the individuals or groups concerned had brought fire-arms with them with the rate intention of creating trouble The Muslim community in Morar elsewhere in the country could have had nothing to gain from provoking confrontation with the police I has suffered enormously in riots in the past Recently it has not been restive either In fact it played major role in bringing Mrs Gandhi and her party back to power and since January nothing has happened to shake its confidence in her fair-mindedness and concern for its well being Only last June it voted fairly solidly for the Congress in the election state vidhan sabha The miscreants alone must be held responsible for whatever has happened In Moradabad they needed provocation which would arouse the entire congregation It duly appeared in the form of pig the animal the Muslims regard as Since its appearance was sure to inflame passion is it not possible that those who had brought the arms with them had also arranged that the pig would stray into the area Hindu communalists among the city and the police force could have pushed the pig towards the Eidgah But surely could not have ensured that some members of the congregation brought arms with them to attack the police without the slightest hesitation Those who were interested in creating mischief had to be in position to produce both the arms and the pig SINGULAR IMPORTANCE If some group or agency was looking for place where it could trigger off country-wide trouble Moradabad would attract its attention in view of the presence of significant helment among its Muslim community its history of Hindu-Muslim troubles its closeness to Aligarh the presence of large number of fire-arrays in the area and the towns general geographical location which would ensure that the tremors of an earthquake there would be felt all over north India This is deductive reasoning from single established fact that Kome Muslims went to JU prayers on Wednesday prepared for station with the police Bui this is the fact of singular importance The police may have over-reacted and thus greatly aggravated the trouble Bui that is different matter which c discussed later The penmen point here is that the behaviour the police serve as evidence to prove that agents have not been at work Moradabad has followed clashes with the army in Kashmir on July 26. In that case the behaviour of the army jawans may have left much to be desired But even if the Jamaatethere was not responsible for the clashes and the outburst of the anti-Indian sentiment on hat. fateful day it has not been willing to help the authorities pacify the situation in the state Despite requests by Sheikh Abdullah its student wing jamaat-eTulba is insisting on holding the proposed international Islamic conference from August 22 to 26 in Srinagar foreign dignitary is said to 5 have offered to meet the entire expense and two hundred delegates from abroad are expected to attend. Only the judicial inquiry will show whether the Jamaat is simple for the blow-up in Moradabad But it has contributed to the creation of an atmosphere in which the mishave felt free to act the way they have AID TO JAMAAT Some oil-rich West Asian governments are said to be extending financial assistance to the extremist and the fundamentalist Jamaat It does not follow that they are interested in destabilising India to use Mr Kissinger's famous phrase Indeed it Is difficult to think of any good reason why even the Jamaat however fanatical would wish to provoke clashes with the police as in Moraand communal troubles elsewhere unless it is by death for the community or it is being manipulated by an external agency For all that we know some unknown and secret group may be rescued for the mischief and not the Jamaal if only because it is the focus of too much attention We must not rush to conclusions in such matters We need to carefully facts from speculation Pakistan has great deal gain by the revival of Hindu-Muslim tensions in India and so have those who are unhappy over Mrs Gandhis to condemn the Soviet vention in Afghanistan and to join the anti-Soviet international campaign on this issue India's prestige find influence suffer if it is plagued communal troubles But even in this regard it would be wrong and dangerous to depend on deductive II The government must insist that its intelligence agencies provide it incontrovertible facts and not intelligent guesses Too much Is at its wake to permit us the luxury of ill-spending on not nbv adequate and reliable evidence lot of oil money has been pouring rt India This has certainly encouraged the extremists and facilitated their task of promoting fundamentalism Of late extremists nt have adopted an aggressive posture of But it must be admitted that they could have done so without much encouragement and financial support from abroad The general decline in respect for and fear of political authority the fall in -the administration including the police and the near collapse of morale in the force would have sufficed The rot 6et in long time ago It was covered from view during the emergency But it has to spread The emergency demoralised the better type of administrators and police officers and created such gulf between the people and the government that anyone who was opposed. to it for whatever reason was assured of popular acclaim The process continued under the Janata because by engaging themselves in endless factional infighting its leaders exposed themselves to ridicule Who could ever respect party which had Raj Narain among its leaders Mrs Gandhi's return to office was widely expected to restore respect for political authority both among the people and the countries enormous and generally inefficient bureaucracy But unfortunately it has not because contrary to her promise she has not produced that works In fact seven months after being sworn in as Prime Minister she has not even fully constituted her council of ministers and she has chosen nonentities as her chief ministers in several states In UP itself she has chief minister who has not proved himself in any capacity so far He good man But that cannot suffice in the turbulent times MEN OF EXPERIENCE On the eve of the election to the Iok Sabha la January Mrs Gandhi admitted to her fold. number of former Congress colleagues who had parted company with her in 1978 Many of them are men of experience and administrative ability They had held office for years earlier and had proved themselves able administrators But as rule they have been kept out of positions of responsibility in favour of those who had stood by Mrs Gandhi in her difficult days in 1978 and 1979 The result is that there are not more than two or three ministers in New Delhi on whom she can depend either or sound advice 0 performance in their own fields The same story is rented at the bureaucratic level key ministries It will be invidious to name them because too many officials have been put in vital positions for no consideration other than this so-called loto the Prime Minister The morale of the administrators and police officers have also suffered since the emergency on account of frequent and arbitrary transfers promotions of those who have been willing to bend or even ignore the rules to please their political bosses induction of political cadres into the administration the spread of corruption among politicians as well as senior bureaucrats and host of other factors All this has bred popular cynicism inevitably creating an atmosphere in which extremists and mischief makers have fielded day
