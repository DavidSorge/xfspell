Charges Against Policemen Inquiry Obligatory For Government By SAKSENA WITHIN short period of about two months from the end of February 1985 to the end of April 1985 there have been three major allegations of police atrocities These are the killing of Man Singh and his associates at Deeg in Bharatmir district of Raiasthan in an allegedly fake encounter on February 21 1985 the excessive firing on tribals on April 19 1985 leading to the death of 15 tribals including Father Anthony former Janata MP in Banjhi village of Sahebganj district Bihar and worst of all police atrocities large groups of people in certain areas of Ahmedabad the most vicious being on April 22 when policemen are alleged to have burnt down Gujarat Samachar and attacked three of several newspapers and encouraged goondas to go or spree of killing loot and arson The instrument of judicial enquiry has been devised by our lawmakers to enable the government to provide justice in such cases. However it appears that judicial inquiry is being treated by the government as permit or licence to be bestowed in its discretion as favour This is politically motivated perversion of fine instrument In the Deeg incident comes from an impending state as a sembly election led to the immediate announcement of judicial inquiry and even the resignation of the chief minister In Bihar the state government has been criminally negligent in looking after tribal interests good part of the hundreds of crores sanctioned for tribal welfare has gone into the pockets of politicians contractors bureaucrats arid engineers at Patna and Ranchi When newspapers started revealing this murky background the chief minister Of Bihar was wise enough to yield to pressure and announce judicial inquiry Shameful. Performance Surprisingly no judicial inquiry has been ordered in the worst of these three instances namely the allegations of police brutalities in Ahmedabad. These have the gravest implications for democracy itself Owing to the widespread and bitter controversy over the reservation issue itself the authorities in Delhi have lost given it the serious attention it Reserves It was treated as side issue and owing to the many alleged provocations given to policemen the official attitude was that of forget and forgive The lead in this respect was given not only by the chief minister of Gujarat Mr Splanki by the Union home minister Mr Chavan who in his reply to the debate in the took Sabha on April 24 1985 said the death of the head constable by adverse reporting in the press on an earlier decision of the judicial magistrates court certain policy officers from entering into Raipur and Khadia areas had deeply hurt the feelings of the police force which already demoAH credit due to Mr Nehru the governor who during his broadcast over radio and on May 4 1985 said that the police have behaved in manner unbecoming uniformed service and expressed his anguish for the sufferings of the people particularly of his sisters and daughters in Gujarat The shameful performance was that of Mr Solanki who at the All India Congress Committee session in Delhi overlooked all this and concentrated his fire on the foreign forces One may ask what are our own forces repeatedly revamped doing if foreign forces are seen to be having free hand everywhere When the disturbances Hyderabad city was of minor character as compared to these in Ahmedabad the then Prime Minister Mrs Indira Gandhi sent directive to the NTR government in Andhra Pradesh to restore peace at once there appear to be different standards for Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh Added Complication Let us start with the assumption that Gujarat Samachar was guilty of exaggeration and that much of its criticism was unfair Provocation is at most an extenuating circumstance but never justification Murders of policemen by mobs are not infrequent in India and if each such murder leads to rampage by the police we will have the spectacle of two rival unruly mobs This is certainly not what uniformed force is trained and drilled for As regards unfair criticism it is an indispensable part of criticism itself If all -criticism has to be based on foolproof evidence it will meant virtual suspension of work even in legislatures In democracy there are various methods of meeting unfair criticism government agency can easily utilise radio to answer all such criticism It can issue press notes The vast majority of newspaper readers outside Gujarat are not well the allegations against in Ahmedabad unparalleled in the police judicial inquiry will clear the air and is likely to isolate the guilty individuals and save the entire state police being held guilty it will nail certain allegations as untrue while confirming the truth of others it will make list of the circumstances which led few policemen to go berserk it will pinpoint the wide swing in the direction of the state government At first the police were ordered to be soft and even allow certain acts of lawlessness When the situation went out of hand and communal rioting erupted the government issued verbal orders to the police. not merely to be tough but to teach lesson to the anti-reservationists Both legally and psychologically the police are not suitable instruments for teaching lessons to any of the people but once they get borders from the top they usually go beyond the permissible limit There was an added complication in this caseIn all states now the police force has several thousand men who have obtained entry on the basis of the reservation quota and they are naturally against the antiThese men got their opportunity when Orders went out for get-tough policy It is obvious that it is the fear of the last point. that is preventing the government from ordering judicial inquiry It is necessary to list the allegations The Ahmedabad police control room was misused by the wireless staff to issue calls to all. policemen to collect at Astodia police station for virtual mutiny It is from there that policemen in plain clothes fanned out for revenge The arson and vandalism against Gujarat Samachar was organized by the police on April 22 1985 reading of the first issue of this paper after its long closure can convince anyone that the paper will continue to fight unless it gets justice Naked policemen turned exhibition front of young girls and The police say that the agitators used women to heckle them by obscene gestures Women in certain areas were beaten and molested on large scale The police say that they had no alternative as women formed the front ranks of the attacking mob Indira Garibnagar is colony inhabited mainly by poor Muslims It is alleged that policemen encouraged goodnas to enter this colony and to indulge in killing and tooting It is said that policemen supplied petrol and kerosene for arson Policemen in plain clothes In arson and burnt down shops and hutments Policemen say that uniformed policemen were subjected to heavy brick-batting in the small lanes of Asarpur Gomtipur Khadia and Saraspur number of journalists were terrorized and manhandled Policemen complain that journalists mafalse photographs to prove atrocities Silver Linings If these allegations are false judicial authority must refute them if they are true the guilty policemen cannot be permitted remain in uniformed force If the chief minister is sure of his facts he should also welcome judicial inquiry It is not dear as to whom the state government is trying to mislead by not Ordering judicial inquiry Grisly details of police misconduct have appeared not only in newspapers and magazines in Gujarat but also in journals that have all-India circulation Even foreign journals have covered this issue Newsweek of May 6 1985 had write-up based on the anti-police version Policemen have their own list of grievances which reached the boiling point when one of their head constables was murdered in barbaric manner They went on strikeIn contrast to the lack of leadership shown by senior police officers in UP during the PAC mutiny in May 1973 and the mutiny of the Punjab police 1979 Mr Jha commissioner of police Ahfaced his men boldly and was able to get them back to work after an absence of only half day Some credit is also due to the much-maligned SRP commandant Mr Vashisht for forcing the constables to observe protocol by first permitting senior officers to lay wreaths on the body of the deceased head constable These are the only silver linings in an otherwise. murky story Policepublic cooperation in Gujarat is now finished and this is on major reason for the conof violence 7 After when Presidents rule imposed in Kerala on July 3 1 1 959 and the Namboodripad government dismissed the main justification given by the then minister Pandit Govind Ballaban Pant in Parliament was the breakdown of the rule of law in the state This situation was reached long back in Gujarat when the state government virtually ended the fact of police brutalities but justified on the ground of provocations
