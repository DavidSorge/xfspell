gration Conference noting should have erupted in Aligarh where criminal elements have been particularly active of late is further evidence of the extent to which the evil of comhas contaminated so many parts of the country further significant fact is that the immediate cause of the flareup was communal rioting on the campus of Aligarh University Student rioting is bad enough but it is reprehensible when such rioting is inter-communal It is particularly tragic that young men studying at our universities should be the victims of disease that have already assumed the proportions of major national problem Among other things the Aliincident should direct the nation's attention to serious weakness in the educational system to which unfortunately the NLC did not pay adequate attention This is the existence of casteist and communal schools and colleges There seems to be no reason now to question the fact that Aligarh University is hotbed of command in this respect Aligarh is by no means alone Mr Sanjiva Reddy very pertinently informed the Integration Conference that unrest in universities and schools can generally be ascribed to the activities of those coming from. blatantly non-secular institutions Unfortunately the Conference did not draw the necessary conclusions and members of the Congress Integration Committee who participated in the NLC deliberations failed to emphasize the insidious role of casteist and communal educational institutions to which they themselves had drawn the nations attention in their report Many pertinent things were said on the subject of textbooks by which to create a necessary degree of national mindedness but hardly enough if anything was said on another aspect of the problem that discouraging section schools colleges and universities So-called national text-books will be ineffective if communal institutions persist and it is not for nothing that such institutions in other countries are not entitled to state aid It is only in this way that national system of education can be established with positive and constructive outlook free of any communalist tint The least that should be done surely is to submit the problem. to the National Integration Council so that specific measures can be discussed and introduced as quickly as possible interest The citizens of Aligarh on their part should co-operate in every possible way with the administration to ensure that communal frenzy does not deinto widespread defiance of law and order The lesson of Jabalpur should not be forgotten and the fact that so soon after National Intel It is to be hoped that the authorities concerned will put down with stern hand the shocking communal flare-up in Aligarh Certain measures have already been taken and if needed harsher steps should be taken in the public Grim Reminder
