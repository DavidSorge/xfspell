SURAT MASSACRE-II SURAT MASSACREII No room for collective welfare By HARISH KHARE SURAT January 18 spoke meaningfully of former officers like Gadhvi Saheb and Sibal Saheb They were understanding officers realistic officers who accepted the ground realities You are told that had Gadhvi Saheb been there he would have spoken to lew -makers and max would be that wise police officer must keep these channels of communication open Yet the sullenness of the police force alone cannot explain this lapse into unspeakable barbarity visit to the Verachaha Road area proves bit enlightening Known Chhota Saurashtra this area is barely respectable ghetto mostly of those working in the diamond cutting industry Chronic drought conditions have over the years forced large-scale migration Saurashtra to Surat The area reeks of toughness In the Verachaha nightlife Saurashtrians very much at odds with the Surti culture in the city but not yet part of it They sleep in cubby-holes in shifts In those crammed apartments they must find love comcast, shared anger shared prejudices unrealised dreams and of course unfulfillable fantasies cultivated in the neighbourhood blue-film parlours These Saurashtrians too have reasons to be sullen Most of them find they have been swindled off their savings by builders and contractors Those who could afford to buy roof over their head find themselves saddled with substandard and unauthorised flats But they cant do damn things to these builders have had powerful patrons in the Congress in the 1980s They are also protected by muscle-men who have enjoyed patronage over the years from Congress politicians If Messers Amarsinh Chaudhry Patel and Chimanbhai Patel 1 were in desperate search of lieutenants and land-grabbers like Mohan Dhanji and Manubhai Pittiawada were in search of godfathers Policemen politicians and government officials whisper how sons of senior politicians in Gandhinagar have become big names in land deals One prominent. builder is spoken of in awe as the de facto chief minister He must informally clear all police appointments in the he cannot be contacted He is in Gandhinagar The assembly session has started chief minister needs his advice The Verachaha Road area became the most natural breeding ground for lumpen Hindutava When Mr LK Advani came to address an election meeting in the area five lakh people thronged to hear the message of Ram rajya And in the past few months recession in diamond and textile industries has spelt job stagnation and unemployment Hindutva was soothing palliative in an environment apparently dominated by dangerous forces and personalities At quite the other end of the Surat spectrum is Mr Kadir Pirzada an articulate middle-aged leader of the Congress former mayor of Surat he lives in breathtakingly posh pent-house the view from his living-room does not admit the squalor that pervades large parts of Surat Mr Pirzadas opulence invites questions about his sources of income He half-convincingly replies that he has family business in the art-silk industry Later senior official of the Surat Municipal Corporation would allege that Mr Pirzada was the main beneficiary. of the massive octroi evasion racket in the city Mr Pirzada cannot fully explain why he and other Congress leaders cannot meet the BJP challenge His one reason is too much democracy in the Congress while the word of Mr Kansiram Rana is the fatwa for one and all in the BJP He does not care for the charges against him and others of hobnobbing with criminals and communalists These BJP-people always do his Goebbles he says He points just Look live between the two most famous temples in Surat Mr Pirzada is quintessential product of Surat Yes there is lot of wealth in Surat It is the costliest city in the country Too much of money too much of black money But perhaps in no other town in Gujarat the disparities between the haves and have-nots are so glaring as in Surat It is five per cent versus the rest of 95 per cent says Mr Desai Unlike say in Ahmedabad there is no reluctance to flaunt one's wealth Growth arid prosperity in the past two decades came in mutually exclusive doses One young ex-corporator Mr Sudi Patel says in Surat only four categories of people have wealth politicians official police municipal and revenue builders and diamond and textile barons the rest of us must live with unfulfilled aspirations The business community denounces the politicians and their insatiable appetite for power and wealth But Mr Ramesh Gajiwala president of South Gii jarat Chamber of Commerce pleads helplessness in standing up to these parasitical politicians He concedes that each businessman puts self-interest above those of the class and community That is why the politicians call the shots The chief minister takes great pleasure in keeping the chamber president waiting for an hour he says But they all believe that Surat would not go the Ahmedabad way that what happened in the second week of December was simply bad dream Surtis are not bad they are not communal there is no breakdown of social and civic arrangement There will be no repeat he claims Yet city has imbibed so much of the money making culture that there is no capacity for thinking about collective welfare Manners and opinions in the city are shaped by the textile and diamond barons their cohorts in the government hierarchy Was it then politicians riot communal conflagration Or criminals revenge Concluded
