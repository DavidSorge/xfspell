Curfew saved the day in Deonar By MEHER BOMBAY January 25 IN the city's bleak and seemingly hopeless scenario comes the startling bit of information that Deonar which recorded the highest death rate i Bombay during the December riots passed the January holocaust with the lowest death count In December it had reported 56 deaths against the official city tally of 205 but in January while Bombay whole reported more than 550 dead Deonars tally was only five Five deaths among population of two to three lakhs would normally be shocking but so radically has the mood of the metropolis been altered in less than two months that one shamelessly sighs in relief at only five deaths Official police figures reveal that there have been three stabbings three cases of arson and three people have been injured in police firing People from both communities agree that the destruction in January has been much less and maintain it was the early ton of curfew that helped contain the volatile situation In December curfew was imposed after four days when much damage had already been done but this time it was declared as soon as news about violence in other parts of the city started coming in, says Mr Sheikh Zia ul Rehman of Shivajinagar The presence of the army gave us feelings of security but our main reassurance came from the senior police inspector Mr Sudhir Jadhav If there are 10 officers like him Bombay can be saved Mr Jadhav was transferred to Deonar only on December 31 and works under the DCP Mr Pawar who was responsible for chasing the notorious gangster Vardha out of Bombay He is known to be disciplinarian who has arrested constable for being drunk on duty But while he may have helped until confidence among the people other factors have contributed to the tion of violence in Deonar The most significant is the Hindu-Muslim ratio of 3070 In December riots the minority community incensed by the demolition of the Babri Masjid seemed to have been rebelling after which they were ruthlessly targeted by the police But in January when the Hindutva forces were on the offensive their minority status made it safer for them to keep the conflict to minimum Only ten per cent of Baiganwadis people are Hindus so we cant afford to start trouble says the local Shiv Sena pramukh Mr Balkrishna Gharate But if somebody else starts trouble we will certainly retaliate Nearly 50 per ce cent of the people both Hindus and Muslims have left Deonard and their houses have been looted Some houses have second lock put on them so when the owners return they will have to pay the person who protected their homes in their absence The goodnas who left Deonar have participated in rioting in other parts of Bombay Some who were not seen for days have now returned and the people are afraid there might be fresh trouble Dharavi Asia's largest slum that houses scores of hardened criminals provides another surprising statistic Here the death toll dropped from 34 in December to 23 in January while the number of people injured in stabbing and firing incidents fell from 167 in December to 68 in January Once again the credit goes to freshly appointed police officer DCP Sanjay Pandey of whom people of both communities speak well Mr Pandey was transferred to Dharavi in the thick of riots on December 8 In the lull after the storm he along with the dauntless social worker Ms Sushobha Barve initiated the process of forming peace committees at the central as well as at Mohalla levels We tried to identify people who can influence others gave them authority by appointing them on the peace committee then made them responsible for maintaining peace in their areas says Mr Pandey It's not possible for the police to be present everywhere all the time The community must take some responsibility for law and order If man is being stabbed and 10 people watch without interfering they are tacitly corroborating in the crime so arrest them all In both Deonar and Dharavi continuous rounding-up of antisocial elements despite pressures from all political parties has also contributed to the decline in the crime rate In both places law enforcement officials maintain that goondas can neither be classified as Hindu nor Muslim but simply as goondas and have to be dealt with as law-breakers regardless of their origin. It is this unbiased attitude of few officers that has won them the confidence of the people Logistically Dharavi poses special problems Connecting its half dozen motorbike roads is complex maze of bylanes each barely three feet wide with dyeing and leather works using sulphuric acid flourishing in tenements along each side Anyone in the lanes during riot runs the risk of falling victim to physical or an acid attack In January however, rooftop violence was controlled in novel way BEST ladder normally used for changing the bulbs of streetlamps was converted into lookout tower for the police Their birds eye view dissuaded mises they knew they were visible and could be targeted within seconds The Deonar and Dharavi instances show that courage ingenuity and the will to be effective are more important in riot than brute force.
