Jamshedpur outrage--1 Jamshedpur -l g8 MwimiMmrs No sign of normalcy despite claims By JANAK SINGH After the death of her husband some time ago Tanvir Janak life was not exactly happy She had four small children all under 12 years of age and no source of income However she coped with the adversity as best as she could She rented out half of her house and was using the money to bring up her family But on Sunday she was wailing Her dazed children stood around unable to comfort her Pointing her finger towards the bloodspattered verandah of her neighbour's house in Shastri Nagar she kept saying When Dada is gone how can live here now Who will protect us Dada was an elderly man who used to look after the family few days ago when communal fanatics control of the town and law enforcement agencies apparently took holiday Dada was done to death right in the verandah of his house Tanvir Jans tenants fled in terror immediately after Dada's death And the poor widow is afraid that no new tenants may want to live in her area which has been the scene of communal carnage Tanvir Jans is not an isolated case Her plight is indeed typical of what has happened to countless innocent people. caught in the crossfire of communal warfare that broke out in Jamshedpur last week for the second time in less than five months The people of the steel city had hardly recovered from the April. bloodbath in which over 200 lives were lost and scores of houses gutted when the communal beast began stalking it once again Renewed riots have already claimed 20 lives of both majority and minority. communities Over 550 have been arrested educational institutions closed and non-mal life of this beautiful town nestling amid low-lying hills on one side and Tatas steel complex on the other disrupted Even though officials and visiting ministers of the state and Central governments keep on repeating that normalcy is returning fast this is far from the case Tatas Jubilee Park and sprawling lawns. which used to attract lots of visitors especially courting couples wear deserted look Educational institutions government offices and houses of people living in areas where numbers of their community are in minority being guarded by armed constables who in spite of their ubiquity look singularly out of place Bombs officially described as crackers continue to explore in one colony or the other

arrest on Saturday of Maulana Arshadul Qadri religious leader whose speech after the Id is alleged to have been one of the main reasons for sparking communal riots in Jamshedpur once again The curfew hours are being steadily reduced presumably to give the people the feeling that the situation is improving But those living in Jamshedpur know that the impression is misleading and that it is being created perhaps under pressure from the state and Central governments Prof Jim of the Geo-operative College who lives in Aditpur says whatever might be claimed by officials the fact remains that fear perthe town The Hindus are afraid of the Muslims and the Muslims of the majority community do not move out of my house after dark Even during the day one is extremely alert and vigilant while moving about in trouble-prone areas How can they have confidence iii the administration and believe all is well when fishmonger can be stabbed to death in daylight in the Kadma market area Even if educational institutions reopen cant send my children to school when every day 1 hear rumours that the people of the other are making plans to set bus on fire in the same way as an ambulance was burnt during the April riots Mr Zaheer Rizvi an electrical engineer living in the Dhatkidih area said in this atmosphere of violence can't even go for duty to the factory where am employed We cannot visit our friends and relations for fear of being attacked Our corn finance in the administration to protect us has been completely shaken You see the situation is so bad that even Harijans have been instigated to attack us can understand communal faThey have their own logic and they are in both communities But it is hard to think Harijans acting in the diabolical manner in which they have done in the past few days The fresh outbreak of communal violence in Jamshedpur has put the maximum strain on the life of peaceful citizens who have nothing to do with communalists or harbour communals thoughts Unfortunately most of the people who have died or been injured in the recent disturbances also belong to this category Kohinoor Lai Harijan student of ninth class was trying to control.
