India Is Not Secular But Is It Necessary Moradabad Sambhal Aligarh Kanpur Allahabad Hyderabad last year The wounds have hardly healed and we have now Biharsharif it is easy to despair No it is almost natural to despair and question the very basis on which we have tried to build our political system Akhilesbwar Jria does that in the article that follows But the issue is extremely complex It is obvious that secular polity cannot be rooted in religion and that secular state is a necessary condition for our very survival But it is equally clear that the awareness of identity cannot be divorced from an acceptance of the past and that Hie European experience even in modified form cannot possibly be repeated here We have not had renaissance as Europe had in the 1 5th and 16th centuries And we cannot have one Renaissance in Europe was the product of the revival of the pre-Christian Graeco-Roman tradition which only lay dormant in the medieval period There was similar non-theological sophistical culture in India But it got fully absorbed in the religious stream and it cannot be revived We tend to take an idealised view of the West Northern Ireland and the recent outburst of anti- Semitism in France is testimony to the fact that religious conflict is not thing of the past even in Europe In America we are witnessing the revival of Christian evangelism with vengeance and since the dawn of nationalism in the 18th century Europe has engaged in highly destructive wars in the name of this new goddess No there is no fool-proof solution to our problems even in theory But need we despair Our achievement in terms of building and sustaining state which does not discriminate on grounds of religion is truly impressive Moradabad was black mark on our face So is Biharsharif But both could have been prevented if the state machinery was more vigilant and efficient The problem is not so much our religiosity as the poor management of our affairs by EVERY time there is real communal in the country the same explanations as given on such other previous occasions are offered with the same enthusiasm These explanations are well-known First communal violence is said to be caused by anti-social elements Secondly it is attributed to those who are religious fanatics Thirdly it is believed to be created by activities of foreign agents There is fourth conventional explanation usually offered by Indian Marxist intellectuals that it is due to economic exploitation and inequality which however manifests itself in communal form Liberal political scientists and sociologists usually ascribe it to the prevalence of sense of socio-political and cultural insecurity among the members of the minority communities The usual remedial measures taken by the government authorities follow. logically from the explanations given For weeding out the anti-social elements prohibitory legal measures are strictly enforced arrests made and even curfew and collective punitive fines To -J ous fanaticism meetings and prayers comprising various religious groups of people are only held and sermons and lectures given for combing foreign agents teams of GID and CBI officials are deployed in the disturbed areas To reduce economic life people of minority religious groups are helped with financial assistance of various kinds These strategies and measures have failed to achieve the desired objective of building secular India because they have not been formulated on the basis of real diagnosis of the problem The task of real and in-depth diagnosis is not easy It also has the risk of being misunderstood But it is time that the nation's intellectuals and political leaders began to look at some of the deeper more vital aspects of this fast worsening problem What needs to be stressed is that it is really more than a problem of transitory nature it is indeed deep-seated become almost chronic deriving from the basic assumptions underlying India's policy of security. One of these obv that man is primarily and wholly religious being and that everything else in his life must be subservient to his religion In other 1 words religion being his supreme concern it must naturally condition his attitude to all other suspects of his life political economic educational and social These aspects must be made to serve his religion Another closely related assumption deriving from the above is that whatever be mans religion if he is truly religious he will have no animosity towards men of other religions According to this assumption good Hindu will have no quarrel whatsoever good Muslim or good Christian The trouble arises only when bad Hindu conflicts with bad Muslim or bad Christian In other words the trouble arises when man becomes good for then he falls victim to evil motives and becomes an anti-social element It is clear that India's official policy of secularism is based on the above assumptions explicitly or implicitly therefore it has adopted the policy of extending protection to and helping the promotion of all religions In pursuance of this policy liberal provisions have been made riot only for national holidays for few different religions but also almost invariably for exceptions and concessions based on purely religious considerations some of the important reservations in government jobs have naturally become common feature of this policy Again not infrequently Union and state ministers, the Prime Minister and the President go to preside over or inaugurate big religious functions organised by different religious communities All this is calculated to demonstrate the nation's equal respect and concern for all religious groups and its anxiety to promote true religiosity in all religions But the crucial question to ask here is this is this by any means secularism Most Indian intellectual and political leaders adhering to both right and left ideologies would promptly and unhesitatingly answer in the affirmative Yes they say this is surelysecularism The meaning of the term secular however does not quite conform to the kind of secularism practised in India Let us remember that like other modern political economic and educational institutions which have come to us from the West security not an Indian It originated out of the European Renaissance the great intellectual arid humanistic awakening of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in reaction to the thousands of orthodox Christian domination The secular view of life deriving from the new scientific discoveries developed in sharp opposition to the established religious view of life Gradually with the act of scientific knowledge and growth of technology religious element in Europe was relegated to many personal life Awhile the secular view of gained voluntary acceptance in his civic political and -economic life The law of the state came to recognise man primarily as social political economic and increasingly religion became mans wholly personal even private concern The gradual acceptance of this secularism among the common people even in Europe was not easy It involved the ordeals of revolutions and bitter civil strifes -But the point is that ultimately secularism with all its deeply humanistic values could triumph only by relegating mans religion to his personal life Se thus emerged as whole new philosophy of life based on rationalism empiricism and hues against the medieval religious view of life based on superstitious and mystical rituals But the rise of secularism did not mean negation of religion as such It resulted in divorcing of religion from superstitions and rituals in the internalisation of religion in the realm of personal experience and even assimilation of it in the social ethics Continued on Page TV But in the land of religions Nehrus truly secular voice was drowned under religious shoutings from alt corners India Is Not Secular It is very important to remember that India unfortunately has never. gone through the experience of anything like the European Renaissance India has had great religious reformers even comparable to the European Christian reformers like Luther and Calvin, but none even faintly comparable to Galileo Bruno Decartes Bacon Hobbes and Locke not to mention the subsequent galaxy of great scientists and technologists True some impact of this European Renaissance reached India took through the British colonial rule but because it was second or third-hand and distorted even this distorted impact remained confined to the newly-created Anglicised Indians who corrupted the impact still further before it seeped down to other educated half-educated or uneducated people Essentially therefore so far as religion was concerned despite the British rule and English. education India continued to be the land of religions as it had been since ancient times each religion continuing in its ancient superstitious and ritualistic form This is where the whole crux of the problem lies There have of course been religious reformers in each religion in India but they have either upheld ancient superstitions and rituals or when otherwise have been too abstruse mystical. philosophical literary to be effective among the common people It is the same story from Ramakrishna Paramhansa to Aurobindo Their impact has been limited to the elite In Islam to the story is not different Akbars din-ilahi could never become acceptable to the common Muslims IJor could Raskha or Kabr make the slightest impact upon them They have surely become literary celebrated despite their teaching the superstitions and rituals of the Islamic religion continue today in the same form as before among the Muslims in India The point at issue is that religion in India be it Hindu be it Islamic or any other has never had to encounter confrontation with rationalist-humanist movement like the European Renaissance movement which laid the foundation for the emergence of modern science. All religions in India even today therefore prevail in their ancient-medieval forms among the common people Superstitious practices external symbols and ritualistic performances are the common. features of all the Indian religions even today and therein lie the seeds of discord and animosity among common people adhering to different religions It is of course true that in the past to an extent many religions in India have existed amicably side by side but that does not mean that India has secular tradition as it is sometimes claimed For religious tolerance is still religious in character and not secular and the tolerance could at best be only tenuous To say for example that Hindus and Muslims have lived amicably for centuries do not in any way mean they have been secular Indeed Hindus understood Muslims well because like the former latter too were wholly religious in their attitude to life and the world It was case of one religion respecting the other religion but religion all the same If Akbar respected the religion of his Hindu queen it was not because Akbar was secular but because being good Muslim he respected another good Hindu In many -remote Indians villages Muslims participate in Hindu religious festiand Hindus seek blessings from Tazia and Muslim and -yet it is not an example of secularism The primacy of religion is common to both It is in this context that MaGandhi's epoch-making success in arousing the common Indian people during the freedom struggle would appear to have an ambiguity of tragic irony The Mahatma knew both from his own introspective contemplation and his observation of the people from close quarters that they could be mobilized only through some kind of religious appeal An astute politician as he was he blended good deal of religion with politics and as his tactic met with successes he evolved whole political philosophy out of the experiences gained from his most original experiment in modern world history It is Common knowledge that the Indian National Congress before Gandhi was merely club of the few English-educated intellectual elite where they used to discuss constitutional reforms and plead for share in the colonial government Gandhi for the first time gave it mass base and thereby made the Congress party into national political force which was instrumental in winning freedom for India and yet even he could not prevent the dangers inherent in the blending of religion with politics in the country like India For the Indian masses did not quite understand his essential religious message which was deeply imbued with Christian humanism They followed the Mahatma the rishi the guru responded to his call blindly Gandhi did not modify their attitude to religion or life and the world He himself lived the life of good Hindu traditional good Hindu hoping that this would inspire also Muslims to be good Muslims But neither the common Hindus nor the common Muslims were in the least affected Indeed Muslims in general got more and more alienated and Hindus more and more befuddled as a result of which people of both religions became vulnerable to easy tation by the power-lusty intellectual politicians demand for the creation of separate Muslim nations in the circumstances was not unnatural Gandhi always made appeal to the religious secular man which tended to arouse more religious than political traditionally nonexistent susceptibilities of the Indian people In the circumstances crafty power-lusty politicians could easily exploit the religious enthusiasm of the people for their own petty political gains Viewed from this -perspective partition of the country on religious basis would appear as tragic inevitability And yet even after the tragedy of partition and the failure of Gandhi to make his brand of security on extension of patronage and promotion of all religions India since independence has been following the policy of what may be called religious secularism as evolved by Gandhi rather than secularism in the European-American sense of the term The result is there for any one to see Religious animosity far from abating has on the other hand gone on increasing in the last three decades Exceptions concessions and reservations on religious ground grant of equal patronage to all religions and so on have been of little avail So have been incessant preaching and propaganda for maintaining communal harmony in the country Nor are they going to succeed in time to come It should be easy to know why India is land of religion and each of its religions among the common people of both urban and rural areas still prevails in its almost primitive form It is exdemocratic and rich and is therefore likely to come into open conflict With the other And under the slightest incitement and provocation the conflict can flare up into violent rioting Investigations into recent riots in northern India have revealed that the immediate cause of the eruption of violence in each case has been almost trifling It is possible that this immediate cause has been brought into play by national anti-social or foreign elements But it is clear that the manipulated cause succeeds in touching off religious violence because the common people steeped in different religions and encouraged in their religiosity by the strange Indian policy of secularism become easily excited with religious enthusiasm this would not have been possible if every one were an extraordinary man of vision like Gandhi Unfortunately it is impossible The common people are ordinary souls who would worship Gandhi from distance but feel perfectly at home with their traditions of social customs and religious rituals with small aspirations and worldly desires to expect them to live up to the Utopian Gandhian ideals is to be highly unrealistic and impossibly idealistic If Gandhis close disciples have failed to live up to the Gandhian ideals how could the Indian masses Nevertheless Indian policy of secularism or the very Indian concept of secularism derives from Gandhi and if it has failed to bring about even workable harmony among different religions in India it is not because The policy is bad It is on the contrary too good too Utopian to be of any practicable use The only exception to the rule was Jawaharlal Nehru Ever since he became Indias first Prime Minister he fought Herculean battle for promotion of the secular view in free India Being deeply read in European history he knew that secularism was for India's survival and that it could only be achieved by neglecting if not rejecting the religious and promoting the secular view of life He also was fully aware that real secularism can be maintained only through restructuring the society and economy on the basis of modern scientific and technological knowledge Assiduously therefore he laid the foundation of real secular India with heavy industries scientific laboratories and technological institutes huge dams vast reservoirs gigantic power stations fertilizer plants and so on Hs called them the new temples of the new India in the making But in the land of religion Nehrus truly secular voice was drowned under religious shoutings from all corners Masses did follow him but to them he was more the chosen political heir of Gandhi than as leader when they fully understood and felt with And when Nehrus opponents accused him of being godless and atheist the masses half believed them By the time Mrs Gandhi came to power the religious basis of India's secularism had got firmly entrenched itself in the policy In her own way she has been trying to keep religion aloof from state policy but the heavy burden of the legacy bequeathed by India's recent history has been painful constraint in her genuine concern for promoting real secularism in the country In the given situation democracy itself with its mechanism of elections functioning of pressure groups and needs of postures becomes another imperceptible but imponderable constraint Despite these constraints forward-looking modern scientific thrust in her national position, she does tend to foster the limited extent truly secular outlook
