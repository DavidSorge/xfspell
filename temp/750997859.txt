UP frenzy rocked even dormant towns By ATUL CHANDRA The Times of India News Service LUCKNOW Nov 6 18 nas never nice mis before People in most parts of UP have passed sleepless nights living in state of fear shaken now and then by wild rumours and frenetic slogans The events at Ayodhya have left wound that is too deep to heal easily and quickly While the one apparently fall-out of the symbolic kar seva performed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP in Ayodhya and the firing by para-military forces has been the outbreak of communal violence in several parts of the state the other and more dangerous. fall-out has been the sharp polarisation of society on communal lines There are places in the state where this polarisation already exists to lesser or greater degree Tension between communities killings and mutual mistrust and dislike are not new to those living in these areas But there also are places where communal harmony has been part of the cultural heritage What is frightening is the change that has come about almost overnight even at such places where the interaction between Hindus and Muslims was without any prejudice based on religion until the recent happenings in Ayodhya It is in view of this that killings in communal frenzy at places like BiMeerut Moradabad and Aligarh are insignificant compared to the trauma of for example Lucknow where for the first time in the state. capitals post-Independence history two people were killed because they were Hindus or Muslims Indeed Lucknow cannot be compared to any other place in the state The city of Wajid Ali Shah relatively quiet even in 1986 when other parts of the state were rocked by violence after the opening of the locks of the Babri Masjid-Ramj Janambhoomi shrine following the district court order of February 2 of that year There was tension and Muslims courted arrest in protest In one locality there was an incident of and in another police patrol party was fired at The police fired 15 rounds of teargas shells in retaliation and the mob dispersed As precautionary measures ten companies of the Border Security Force BSF were deployed That was the end of the trouble Four years later the city has been jolted -Mistrust has taken root and passions have been aroused Fortunately there are areas where sanity still reigns Though the city is yet to get out of the painful spasm people are relying on time the big healer and praying that the worse will not happen Compare this to some of the other places Immediately after the court order tension began to escalate in communally sensitive areas. Between February 25 and March-end in 1986 25 people had been killed in riots at different places in the state By 1988 the toll had risen to 149 all dying in incidents related to the Ayodhya Shrine Ten were killed in Meerut in 1986 where riots take place with disturbing regularity There were two riots there in 1987 which took toll of 1 10 lives and in 1988 in which four people were killed Twenty-two people were killed in Muzaffarnagar and Khatauli 16 in Bara Banki ten in Allahabad eight in Pilibhit five in Faizabad four in Allahabad three in Varanasi and three in Sultanpur In all there were 1 2 major riots till 1 988 The minor incidents with communal overtones totalled 19 Significantly Faizabad where the disputed shrine is located witnessed only one outburst of frenzy The situation in the preceding years was different in that the army had played minimal role in tackling the communal situation This time the feelings were so much incensed that the army's assistance had to be sought even in place like Lucknow and nearly half of the state had to be placed under curfew These are fire-fighting measures But the disease that has set in would be difficult to cure Who can assuage feelings of Hindus who are angered over the killing of unarmed kar sevaks and of Muslims who are agitated over the damage caused to the Babri masjid Tales of brutalities against the kar sevaks Ayodhya and in some of the jails have received spontaneous reactions People have thronged hospitals contributed food donated blood and money and extended moral support to the injured in big ways. sight of the injured has added fuel to the fire The variety of Hindutva subsequently manifested itself in slogan-shouting But what actually saved the situation was that the ire of the people was directed against the chief minister Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav who is being likened to cruel teachers
