Colour bias against Calcutta By SUBHASH KIRPEKAR NEW DELHI June IT VISION viewers in Calcutta may not be able to see direct telecasts in colour of the Asian games to be held here in November. Calcutta Doordarshar does not figure in the list of six cities which will have the privilege of witnessing direct telecasts This difficult has arisen mainly because of communications ministry inability to provide microwave channel In view of the fact that left from government rules West Bengal the likelihood of that government protesting against being left out from this major sports event In that event political controversy may erupt over this issue Direct telecasts of various events can be seen in Delhi and Mussoorie Bombay and Pune and Madras and Bangalore Of the 18 TV. transmitters in the country only six will have equipment that will make them compatible And the six stations named above will be the beneficiaries The information and broadcasting ministry has placed an order worth Rs 45 lakhs for this special transmitter equipment which is expected to be installed in October Incidentally no Jale has yet been fixed for starting colour telecasts There is chance of the independence-day celebrations being telecast in colour This optimism is based on the arrival of two OB vans by the end of July Another two OB vans are expected by the end of August. tcVUnfortunately the suggestion of the inter-ministerial working group on colour television has been perhaps in view of the pressures generated by the desire to telecast the Asian games in colour The group had suggested that introduction of colour transmission and production of colour TV sets be done in co-ordinated present situation is that while established manufacturers of black-and-white TV sets have been permitted to import certain components worth Rs 1250 per set and assemble colour TV sets the ministry of science and technology has announced that long-term licensing policy manufacturing colour TV sets is separately under formulation and will be announced soon The ministry is quite clear that it is allowing imports of components only to cater to the urgent requirements. of the Asian games The question in the minds of inTV manufacturers pertains to the investment they will make on producing colour TV sets now What if the policy announced later is unsuited to small-scale sector making colour TV sets they ask They think it rather strange that they should make the investment now and the policy should later It is like putting the cart before the horse remark 1 killed on suspicion MADRAS June 17 PTI Thevar caste Hindu was killed this morning in Nallur Tirunelveli district allegedly by Harijans of the village who have formed patrols fearing caste Hindu attacks following the recent clashes in the district Police sources here said one such patrol which had attacked the man suspecting he had come to do them harm later set fire to haystack Their own colony to create the impression that the stranger was troublemaker The victim bore multiple injuries the sources said Thirteen Harijans have been arrested
