Moradabad Has More1 Arms Than ILK By SAKSENA former inspector-general of police IlHEN the Lok Sabha was dissolved on December 28 1970 and the elections announced for February-March 1971 communal tension started building up in UP District officers avoided taking firm action After the polling was over in the rest of UP on March 5 1971 trouble broke out In Exchanges of brickbat and aerated water bottles were followed by staging incidents throughout the city It took the authorities five days to suppress the riot's thedeath toll being 16 mainly as result of stabbing in lanes and The day curfew was finally lifted on March 16 The same pattern is now being repeated on much bigger scale JVhat has happened since 1 The first and foremost reason for the carnage on the present scale is that the total of firearms both legal and illicit with anti-social elements has multiplied several times over There are more firearms with private individuals in Moradabad district about 22000 licensed besides unlicensed ones than in the whole of the United Kingdom or Japan We have virtually permitted arsenals to be built up in each district for rebellion against lawful authority An unduly liberalised arms act of 1959 as compared with the previous act of 1878 unlimited corruption in the issue of licenses and political recommendations for bad chaaccount for these arsenals As result the civil police in police stations and outposts have become practically useless In fact they need to be protected from hooligans armed with sophisticated weapons Police divided The second unfortunate change is that the police is no longer united organisation led by the inspector general of police During the last four years the UP been divided into we and they with the change of government they become we and we become they The third change is the time of the police In 1971 the Hen DIG the late Mr Arya who was later killed as IG Mizoram by the insurgents organised large-scale house searches on the second day of the trouble itself today police officer dreads this prospect because he fears that when the excitement dies down he may face allegations including that of mass rape of women The fourth change is the complete loss of local initiative In 1971 the late Mr Arya carried on to the bitter end with local resources supplemented only by one battalion of the CRPF Today officers arc happy to pass on the responsibility to the army and paramilitary forces like the CRPF and the BSF The local police are highly susceptible to blackmail by local politicians because their armour is full of chinks Central forces are not subject to blackmail but they lack detailed knowledge of the town which is essential for dealing with -communal riots The fifth chance is -that anti-social elements make preparations for days and weeks without any one becoming wiser or more important taking preventive action This is not always the result of failure of intelligence No superintendent of police anywhere in India today can afford to take advance action because he will not receive backing if his motive is distorted We lack stalwarts like Pandit Pant with their detailed mastery of facts figures to satisfy the legislature and the press The sixth change is the poor local knowledge of the officers It takes about a year for superintendent of police or an SHO to get thoroughly acquainted with the geography and problems of his area and before he has so equipped himself he is generally transferred When the political executive issues transfer orders by the thousands they take it that ono SHO can replace another without any difficulty Mischief-mongers walk inside the cities of Morada bad and Rampur will convince them that an SHO has to get acquainted with 15-20 miles of lanes. bylanes the composition of the population in every lane the names of mischief-mongers the location of temples and mosques the storage points of brickbats and aerated water bottles and numerous other details essential for dealing with any disturbances We have come to the ridiculous position when superintendents of police and SHOs need guides in their own judges during these nine years resources at the disposal of the ties have multiplied but the handicaps have increased many more times -much greater fire power of the divisions inside the police poor morale loss of local initiative hesitation taking strong action and poor local knowledge It will be exceedingly short-sighted to depend on luck We have to assume that Pakistan oil money and many other foreign influences will play nefarious. part in promoting trouble in our country Crores of Hindus and Muslims live side by side so there will never come a day for long time when provocative incidents will not take place The administration has to take these for granted and still succeed It will be wrong to blame any specific government for failure Conn manual riots in Aligarh in October1 December 1978 established record of 85 days of curfew In Jamshedpur
