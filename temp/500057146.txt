Rumours fuelled Baroda riots By ALLWYN FERNANDES BARODA WILD rumours growing militancy among Muslim and Hindu youths that threatens to overthrow the older leadership of the two communities and divided and inept political leadership that proved hindrance rather than an aid to the authorities in restoring peace all these hav contributed to the sudden spora die communal violence in the last fortnight Although the worst is generally believed to be over and the Navratri Id and Divali festivals are expected to pass off peacefully what has happened in this fast-growing industrial town of 750000 people with 12 per cent Muslim population worth closer study to understate the changing forces at work under mine communal peace Though violence was spread over fortnight most of it occurred on three days September 13 15 and 19 The police by most accounts move swiftly and effectively to quell them dis opening fire once on of these days killing one and five persons indulging in rioting looting and arson Thrive more lost their lives in wave of stabbings said to be new feature of communal violence in the city The stabbings are similar to those in Godhra 82 km away where Sindhis and Muslims have been at each others throat for the last ten months over some land Fifty two per cent population in the city comprises Gujaratis The upper class Patrick Banias and Brahmins did not participate in the clashes though the trouble first broke out in Gujarati pocket called Ladwada BREAK-UP Again the students and most of the working class remained onlookers unlike in the 1969 riots which engulfed several towns. in the state Those involved in the trouble this time were mostly Marathas who constitute 35 per cent of the former princely state of the Gaekwads the Bhois or Kahars who are fisherfolk and the Golas or Ranai who Avere said to be involved in occupations like the extraction of oi from groundnuts The Marathas have been rivals of the Muslims with whom they are also economically on par about 60 per cent of them are Brah mins though they are all referred by the common term Marathas Baranpura one of the strife-lorn areas is the stronghold of the middle and working class while the better off live in Dandiabazar which was free of trouble Similarly the Bhois are concentrated in Navapura and Panidarwaza and the Golas in Fatehoura and Sultanpur where the Muslims also live apart from belonging to the same economic strata there is also said to be considerably between the Bhois and the Muslims because of illicit and gambling rackets In fact some of the later isolated cases of violence are believed to be an outcome of this rivalry Though the trouble on the first day was localised and remained to Ladwada that on September 15 and 5 19 seemed organised and co-ordinated according to both administrative am 1 political sources Again because by this time both communities had time to prepare themselves to cope with 5 trouble there was little arson and 1 looting Information from various sources ii both communities indicate also tha while the Muslims reacted 1 to the first provocation this was typical general reaction of Muslims Mr Mohammed Hanif Dayamakumar 5 an advocate who is general secretary Continued on Page 7 Column 1 Factionalism delayed pacification Continued from Page 1 Column 4 of the Gujarat Jamiat-c-Ulcma and chairman of the city waqf committee said the Hindus reacted with looting and arson Only later did they resort to stabbing in manner that officials said could only be the work of professionals The victims on both sides were ordinary people mostly those who had strayed out of their homes during the curfew for some good reason These later killings helped build up pressure within the Muslim community against the militants and enabled the ciders to reassert their authority The Muslims including the deputy mayor Mr Noor Mohammed Campwalla who had boycotted a meeting called by the collector Mr Ashok Chawla on September 14 in protest against the police firing the night before now attended meeting called by Mr Ashok Bhogilal Patel vice president of the Baroda Congress and till recently treasurer of the GPCC at the house of Muslim belonging to his faction Mr Patel is identified with the chief minister Mr Madhavsinh Solanki's faction in the state Congress while most of the Baroda Muslims are known to be close to the state finance minister Mr Santa Mchta who is in the Adam faction which has running feud with the Solanki group The infighting between the two groups is 60 intense that one is accusing the other of having engineered the riots while the other is accusing its rivals of exploiting the situation to its own advantage That this rivalry is bitter was also evident from the failure of Mr Campwella Mr Ghulam Memon fast friend on his own admission of Mr Sanat Mehta and secretary of All-India Muslim Majlis Mushawirat in Gujarat and uther prominent Muslims to meet the minister during his visit to the own on September 22 Mr Campwalla and the rest claimed he had not been invited to meet Mr Solanki although the mayor Dr Latin Modi insisted there was no question of an invitation that there were to gain political advantage out of the riots was also evident from talk about pressure on Mr Campwalla to resign from the Congress in protest against the alleged failure of the Solanki ministry to protect the minority This is the eleventh communal riot in Gujarat since the Solanki government came to power in June 1980 members of the Santa Mehta act on point out This factionalism politicians in both the Congress and opposition camps eel delayed the pacification process and forced the administration to rely on the police to restore norThe present communal trouble in Baroda began in Ladwada Gujarati pocket by Muslims it adjoins Mogalwada where Mr Noor Mohammed Campwalla the deputy mayor Mr Ghulara Memon and others live on September 11 two days before the final immersion the left arm of most of the three Ganesh idols in this locality was found cracked around 4#30 pm Some youths went round the fuca alleging that two Muslim boys bad thrown stone at it according to Mr Ashok Parikh lawyer belonging to the Congress who lost in the elections to the Baroda municipal corporation from this constituency last January as tension built up in the area the police were summoned and after investigations the deputy superintendent of police Mr Tandon the Mr Bhaskar Dave and inspector Pandya of the ifty police station concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that the been damaged by some Muslims Mr Ashok Parikh and Mr MahenMaganlal Shah 57 awayer whom the Muslims respect greatly were also satisfied with the conclusions reached by the police Mr Shah in fact went round the approaches to Ladwada assuring Muslims ihat they were not suspected of damaging the and that they need not worry about it He also reassured Muslim Ike Mr Memon and Mr Campwalla One main reason why the lawyers and the police rule out any mischief by the Muslims is that the idol was located right at the spot where there had been an SRP post in existence since the anti-reservation riots earlier this year In fact the SRP men who are mostly recruited from Maharashtra where the Ganesh festival is very popular live just above the place where the idol was kept The mayor Dr Jatin Modi and the district superintendent of police Mr Mehta both insisted that it was not possible for the Muslims to have been involved because the idol are generally well-protected The could have been natural occurrence Dr Modi said though there were hints from other Hindu sources thai some Hindu youths themselves may have been responsible In fact the police are working on this theory In any case both the Hindus and the Muslims contend that this issue w by the police inquiry and that it does not have any connection with the trouble that broke out two days later Yet the fact remains wild rumours swept the city the next two days that the Muslim had damaged several idols The BJF MLA from Baroda Mr Makrand Desai who lives some distance away from Ladwada admits to hearing the rumours from his cleaning woman Nothing was done to dispel the rumours Mr Ashwin Mehta one of the politically sharper and better-informed among the 60 corporators in the Baroda municipal corporation said that the collector could have called meeting of all communities on September 12 to help dispel the rumours But the administration wondered if it should give importance to them by drawing more attention to them It therefore opted to do nothing4 On September 13 the from Ladwada were taken out in procession in three trucks one of which carried the women of the loThere was strong police presence and about dozen Muslim leaders escorted the procession out through Jamnabai Hospital Lane which passes through Mogalwada Some crackers were fired near the mosque but we took no notice of it Mr Memon said Everyone after there was no hint of trouble WATER THROWN The trouble broke out when no one seems to have expected it as the trucks were returning to Lawada along the route they had left instead of via Gendigate Road which runs through Hindu locality the Muslims content According to the Hindus however they have been returning via the same route for the last years because Gendigate Road is too narrow Mr Mahedrakumar Shah the lawyer the Muslims respect also affirmed this The Muslims also contend that there were no women in the returning trucks indicating that the procession is returned ready for trouble Mr Ashok Parikh and his wife said the women had returned on their own earlier cs they did not want to get home late iAl Ule Jratltnck passed under one the buildings in Mogalwada some one shouted that water had been thrown from above Excited youths alighted from the truck and raised hue and cry SoonMuslim youths also collected some of them armed with sickle with long wooden handle used for cutting branches of hS Uam Nabi Campwalla S2T1 the mayr admitted that the youths may have come armed because they feared or expected an attack on the masjid Meanwhile Mr Ghulam Memon woo was visiting bereaved Muslim family heard of the trouble and rushed to the spot He apologised if any water had been thrown but he was reported to have been abused Realising that the situation was getting out of hand he rushed to the city police station near by and returned with the two groups By this however had spread to the other approaches to Ladwada At the other end at Mogalwada Road two angry mobs were stoning each other Again the Muslims -were reported to be armed with MOB FIRED ON According to the deputy mayor he was trying to defuse the when eubBuch and the desuperintendent of police Mr Cooper arrived on the scene Mr Buch asked for orders to shoot but these orders were not given police officials said little later however Mr Buch opened fire in self-defence in the face of the aimed mob killing one person and injuring two others The filing had salutary effect in that it dispensed the mob and restored peace by midnight Curfew was clamped on the area Passions however remained high in the Muslim moholla because of the firing. There was no trouble in the rest of the city that night not even in nearby Wadi which is highly trouble-prone spot according to the police The curfew continued over the city police station area. next day as 11 companies of po1100 men arrived from Na1 died and Surat to reinforce the 500strong constabulary and 200 home guards The next about 10 am the Muslims allegedly cut gas pipeline and set fire to ground floor godown in Hindu building in Ladwada Though the fire brigade is reported to have been kept at bay for an hour by stone-throwing youths not much damage This was the last major trouble in Ladwada Thereafter the trouble spread to other areas of the city the following day but for another reason Amidst all this violence the Muslims made no efforts to threaten or drive out 20 Hindu families including some Marathas living in Mogalwada North did they damage three shops and five godowns belonging to the Hindus Was the water that sparked the riot really thrown The Muslims deny that it was Both Hindu and Muslim 1 leaders said that was quite common in small town like Baroda to throw 1 water out of window hence water might have been thrown 1 ally and that too much fuss need not have been made about it The police who had sub-inspector in the truck early they have not been able to tain that water was indeed thrown either from their officer or the driver of the vehicle And  there the matter stands ILL-FATED TOUR The situation seemed to be returning to normal when two deputy ministers of the state government who were camping in the city decided to tour the riot-affected area of -Baro on September 15 two days after the trouble began Mr Markand Desai the BJP MLA who was present at the circuit house was also invited to join The others in the group were Mr Patel deputy minister for labour Mr Mohammed Baloach deputy minister for law Dr Shirish Purohit MLA and chief whip of the Congress legislature party Mr Mohammed Patel MLA from Broach and Mr Harival labh Parikh Sarvodaya leader Although top police and administration officials and even local politicians contend the visit was diad vised and ill-timed neither the collector nor the DSP advised them against it at that time according Ip Mr Desai As the group entered Mogalwada unaccompanied by the police it was confronted by Muslim youths still angry at the police firing two days earlier One of the youths whipped out knife scuffle broke out as the politicians tried to disarm him but by that time he had succeeded in stabbing two Hindu youths who had accompanied Mr Desai into the Muslim stronghold Muslim and Hindu leaders contend that it was imprudent on Mr Desais part to have taken them along Muslim leaders in fact allege that they were Ms bodyguards That is not all The Sarvodaya leader was thrown to the ground du ring the scuttle Mr Monammea Patel MLA from Broach was manhandled and his clothes torn According to Mr Ashok Bhogilal Patel vicepresident of the Baroda Congress the Muslim MLAs were attached to embarrass the chief minister at whose instance they had stayed on in Baroda RUMOURS AGAIN Mr Noor Mohammed Campwaiia and others however said that the chief minister was ill-advised to sent nonentities to the area and claimed that Mr Baloach had to identify himself as Muslim to save himself from the enraged youths In any case the peace effort turned into fiasco with all having to take refuge in Mr Campwallas house until the police were able to rush there 45 minutes later and whisk them away in jeeps leaving the ministerial car behind according to Mr Desai This incident sparked off the second round of violence Wild rumours that the BJP MLA had been abducted and stabbed swept the city Similarly rumours that Mr Campwalla had been abducted and assaulted in retaswept the Muslim Community Mr Desai said he swiftly contacted his friends in different parts of Baroda to quell the rumours but in vain he left Baroda for Delhi shortly afterwards to attend party meeting and returned

recalling how the present deputy-mayors father had prevented any trouble whatsoever here in 1969 though his own biscuit factory elsewhere in Baroda was destroyed Such was the mutual understanding and control we exercised then ATTACKS The police now decided to keep the politicians out of the picture All curfew passes were withdrawn and strict curfew was enforced Anti-social elements were rounded up The next three days passed off with isolated assaults in which sticks knives and were used The troublemakers now changed their tactics resorting to hit-and-run attacks Three Muslims were fatally
