SINGH talks to leaders of various political parties on communal riots It is unfair to blame the Para-military Force The Police are demoralised because they have instructions to be cautious while. taking action against Muslims Muslims no longer have faith in the Police Muslims suffer more in loss of life and property If there are a large number of arms in Moradabad who is to blame Who issued The licences Pakistan is trying to create misunderstandings The CIA does not like our policy towards Afghanistan America China and Pakistan do not want India to be strong YiniX Hindus and Muslims live in This question the unambiguous and unanimous answer by leaders of different political hues is in the affirmative Yes Hindus and Muslims will live in her money They can they shall says Mr Mohanlal Sukhadia former chief minister of Rajasthan Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Abdulla Bukhari agrees whole-heartedly So do Dr Bhai Mahavir of the Bharatiya Janata Party on one extreme of the political spectrum and Mr Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait president of the Indian Union Muslim League on the other The trouble is says the Shahi Imam of Jama Masfid that Ae governments since independence nave followed the British colonial policy of divide and rule You remember the saying of Hindu chai and Muslim chai at the railway stations Riots do not occur he says they are engineered If the government is firm and resolute they can be prevented Mr Sukhadia senior Congress MP controverts this charge and asks What can our party gain by promoting riots The Muslims and the Harijans voted solidly for us in the last parliamentary and assembly elections Riots do not occur they are engineered Dr Mahavir puts the blame squarely on the Congress policy of appeasement of the Muslims since before independence This led to partition in 1947 and now manifests itself in frequent bursts of violence he adds Reading extracts from an interview in magazine he says Look at what the Shahi Imam has to say The entire Muslim race has one goal there is no difference between Muslims in India and in other parts of the world Muslims are Muslims first and Indians later The Imam complains that his remarks during the controversial interview had been twisted but he remains firm in his that Muslims are Muslims first and Indians later We see religion in everything The most sacred thing for us is the Quran. Iman faith is important Why should anyone question our love for the country Mr Sait good Muslims will be better Indian because he will be imbued with certain moral values So where is the contradiction between being good Muslim and good Indian Mr Bhola Paswan Shastri chairman of the Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes pertinently tasks Ho can one question the loyalty of the Muslims By and large they are as good patriots as any other Dr Mahavir argues that the feeling of separation is strengthened by preachings of certain extremist Muslim leaders and the Muslim insistence on maintaining their own personal law Mr Shastri Well you cannot impose social customs on community and there are so many qualities in the Muslim culture Mr Sait Why should anyone object to our personal law We want to maintain our cultural identity Freedom of worship is guaranteed in the constitution We will not tolerate any interference with our personal law The Muslim leaders in turn accuse Hindu communal elements of preaching hatred against their community Mr Sait The RSS has been the foremost in this vicious campaign and their Guru Golwalkar writes in book that the Muslims came to India plunder and that they cannot be considered Indians The Shahi Imam of Jama Mas jid feels that the RSS had hand in communal troubles in the past but cannot say that they engineered the riots in Moradabad and other places this month Mr Sukhadia holds that the RSS as well as Muslim organisations like the Jamaat-epromote feelings of hatred but Mr Bhola Paswan Shastri feels that the RSS bogey is raised for political reasons and Dr Mahavir retorts The RSS has been the whipping boy of the Congress People forget that wherever the RSS ran the administration-in Delhi Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh there were no communal incidents These periods were marked by Hindu-Muslim amity and harmony The RSS concept of Hindu rashtra is not discriminatory 1 Miscreants have no religion Their main objective is to create trouble and fake advantage of it If you look back at the communal riots in different parts of the country Dr Mahavir says you will see that the initial spark was provided. by small group of Muslim miscreants It is equally clear that subsequently Muslims suffered more in loss of life and property than Hindus Mr Sulaiman Sait Wells one cannot deny that there are misin the community but then miscreants have no religion their main objective is to create trouble and take advantage of it In his opinion communal elements in the Provincial Armed Constabulary and other para- military forces often provoke disturbances for their own nefarious ends The Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid agrees with this view and alleges that the PAC picked up Muslims in the streets and but them like goats We want to maintain our cultural identity Freedom of worship is guaranteed in the constitution Dr Mahavir springs to the defence of the para-military forces and says that though there may be communal elements it is unfair to blame them wholesale Can any sane person -contend that these forces deliberately created the riots They may have erred in the manner they handled the situation initially they may have even overreacted at times but how can anyone say that they started the disturbances Reverting to his theme of apof the Muslims Dr Mahavir alleges that the police are demoralised because they have instructions to be cautious while taking action against Muslims Even Muslim pick-pockets and burglars cannot be touched and the police often remain helpless spectators their wrong-doings Mr Sait The plain and simple fact is that Muslims no longer have faith in the police Communal elements have entered the force in large numbers In Varanasi the PAC plundered houses during the curfew hours In Mo the riots were the result of conspiracy between communal elements and the PAC The Shahi Imam and others suggest that the minorities including Muslims should be given. heavy representation in the police to create confidence He welcomes the proposal to set up peace force this is my proposal and submitted it to the Prime Minister But the force must be representative of all communities do not know what shape it will take Until it is set up cannot say will be satisfied with it Along with an impartial police force the need for strong admit the local state and central level is recognised on all hands When was chief minister of Bihar says Mr Bhola Paswan Shastri had given firm instructions to the IGP to first quell the riots wherever they happened come to me Thus sensitive areas had already been identified and it was possible for an alert administration to nip the disturbances in the bud Mr Sukhadia agrees and point out that during his chief ministership of Rajasthan for 17 long years barring few minor incidents no communal riots took place Even the existence of illegal arms is not possible without the administration winking at it government they say is to blame If there are large number of arms in Moradabad who issued the licences Obviously the local administration thought it will be found on investigation that in most cases it did so under political pressure Even the existence of illegal not possible without the administration winking at it Why did it not take steps to fish out these weapons Dr Mahavir and Mr Sukhadia give some evidence to the foreign hand theory Dr Mahavir points to Pakistani agents and he refers to slogans of Pakistan Zindabad raised by the rioters Mr Sukhadia says It appears to me that Pakistan is trying to create feeling in other Muslim countries friendly to us that the minorities are not safe here Our relations with Arab countries are good and Pakistan is trying to create misunderstandings between us Other agencies may also be involved For instance the CIA which does not like our policy towards Afghanistan Basically China the USA and Pakistan do not want India to become strong Referring the attacks on the army and the police in the recent spate of disturbances Mr Sukhadia adds This time the confrontation is with the government The idea seems to be to damage the secular image Mrs Gandhi enjoys abroad What of the future Mr Sjut We must take up the matter at the national level and all political leaders should try to find solution The first and foremost thing is to remove mutual. hatred and misunderstanding The Congress should stop looking at the Muslims as vote banks to be used at election time Joint celebration of major Hindu and Muslim festivals fair representation to minorities in the services and the police creation of special riot force and revival of the national integration council are some of the suggestions made Mr Sukhadia adds There should be national consensus no political party would exploit communal feelings Dr Mahavir Congress should stop looking at the Muslims as vote banks to be used at election time Mr Bhola Paswan Shastri There is no dearth of useful recommendations Unfortunately they often gather dust in the government offices All of them agree The bulk of the Muslim population identifies itself with the national mainstream no one should suspect its loyalty or patriotism.
