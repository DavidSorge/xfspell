Demand for emergency in city BOMBAY January 11 MR JRD Tata Mr NA Palkhivala and group of prominent senior citizens today urged the Centre to declare partial emergency under article 352 of the Constitution in Bombay and hand over the city to the army who can deal with the situation without any reports They said in statement here the situation is totally out of hand in Bombay Goondas criminals mobsters and beasts in the form of men have taken over the city During the last four days Bombay has witnessed scenes of violence and lawlessness to which there has been no parallel during the 300-year-old history of the city The blunt truth is that the democratic process of government has failed and what is needed is firm and prompt action sufficiently stern to restore law and order We are clearly of the opinion that the city should be handed over to the army who can deal with the situation without any interference This can be done under the constitution of the Central government. Bombay should be declared to be gravely disturbed area and there should be partial proclamation of emergency under Article 352 of the Constitution Any delay in taking such step would be crime against.
