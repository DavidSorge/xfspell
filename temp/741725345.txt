The riot and the wrong of violence control By Balram BANGALORE spark fanned by rumours is enough to set Bangalore on fire these days The trend has been evident particularly during the last five years. Last Wednesday's mindless violence in the posh Jayarea of the city over petty dispute between two groups ugly over me introduction of an Urdu news bulletin three years ago and the riots in Bangalore over the Cauvery issue in 1991 are few examples Crime grows as the city grows is the general opinion Does not grow in the process Or are vested interests egged on by politicians to exploit such situations Or is our police force too naive to expect such backlash and take pressures These are some questions that need answers But one thing is clear Whenever such incidents occur the government and the police wake up from deep only to go back to sleep as soon as the tension dies Take for instance of Karnatakas Home Minister Roshan Baig on Wednesdays violence Theres no need for any inquiry Ar is instituted when the reason Constable Satyanarayanas wife Ratnamma and daughter Kavita forefront give vent to their grief The policeman had been lynched in the Bangalore riots for such incidents are not known But here we know the reasons Fine An inquiry into the cause of violence may not help Inquiries are often long drawn out and by the time the reports are out the seriousness is lost But shouldnt efforts be made to nab the culprits who held the city to ransom Four precious lives were lost including that of constable who was lynched Scores of innocent persons suffered serious injuries pregnant woman and her husband were injured badly when they banged their car into walls while escaping from an armed mob Public property worth lakhs of rupees was destroyed number of private vehicles were either damaged or burnt down The people in general were put to untold misery When the reason for the violence is known as the minister himself admits the persons who sparked the trouble. may also be known to the authorities If they are immediately brought to book wouldn't that act as balm on the wounded sensibilities of the Bangalorean The police no doubt did commendable job in bringing life back to normal in the city But they too work under tremendous pressure Their problems are many Political pressure It is an open secret that some politicians work with vested interests create such volatile situations Their eye is most often only on the vote banks They put pressure on the police against taking action in such matters And those who refuse to fall in line blacklisted summarily transferred and given insignificant postings The recent abrupt transfer of Durai who did not bow to political pressure in case in point The predicament of junior officers can be guessed Poor facilities On Wednesday police constable Satyanarayana armed with lathi confronted mob wielding choppers and rods He was brutally done to death How can policemen deal with such situations when they have no equipment to protect themselves In big cities all over the world policemen are provided with good vehicles wireless equipment and reHere constable is always seen moving around on. foot or bicycle and his only weapon is lathi It is no use blaming the police unless the government provides them with the necessary gear Failure of intelligence The police are often caught unawares of such volatile situations They do not seem to have any source that alerts them about brewing problem Or they are too lethargic to take information if any seriously For instance when one group of Muslims agreed to help in removing the rubble near the Jayanagar mosque the police should have made efforts to ascertain the views of the rival group too. Had the police taken the rivals too into confidence and convinced them that the rubble clearance was indeed necessary to widen the road for smooth flow of traffic the tension and bloodshed could have been avoided Dispelling rumours during last Wednesdays violence the police officials were found going around in jeeps requesting people to stay indoors good move indeed In the same vein shouldn't they have requested the public not to give heed to rumours In the absence of clear understanding of the situation mishad field day Violence would have continued the next day too had not the media put out the correct picture that it was minor. dispute no place of worship was demolished and the clashes were not communal Only then peace prevailed Normalcy has returned to Bangalore now Will the authorities need another bloodshed to wake up? against the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United St
