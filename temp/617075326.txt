AHMEDABAD Religious frenzy overwhelms Guiarat Gautam Mebta on the communal conflagration in the state AHMEDABAD and Baroda experienced another spell of communal violence in the wake of the second round of kar seva at Ayodhya though there is no overt linkage between the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP inspired campaign and the spree of violence which according to the latest figure has taken toll of 27 lives True violence that has rockvarious parts of Gujarat especially Ahmedabad since Bharatiya Janata Party BJP president Mr LK Advani on October 24 is not very different from previous communal riots At the same time there are new elements also The government and police officials that these 1 riots have been no different from previous riots But the Violence spread to new areas has also taken new form The myth that bootleggers and anti-social elements were responsible for the violence no longer holds good Religious elements has emerged as new important factor that causes and sustains the riots For the first time places of worship are becoming the target of violence The en masse participation of members of both the communities in the street violence is also new aspect. fomented by the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid issue and further catalysed by the local BJP who feel they have scored to settle with the chief minister Mr Chimanbhai Patel In the 1985-86 riots Ahmedabad witnessed large scale violence and six months of continued curfew in the walled city areas but this time not only is the violence large-scale but is also evidently an expression of growing suspicion. and mistrust between the two communities who rather than attack on the public property have resorted to open battles against each other This new phenomenon coupled with the political uncertainty in the state has reduced the police force to an almost helpless spectator Unable to even gauge the gravity of the developing situation at the outset the police repeatedly reacted either too late or too. little The sequence of incidents after October 24 clearly indicate that had the police leadership seen the significance of the first signs of the riots of the situation that have been stopped from getting out of hand Also the communal and disforces themselves have realised that the police force crippled with its own internal bickerings is unable to prevent the spread of violence and therefore The government has to frequently call upon the big brother army to restore law and order While this has on the one hand demoralised the ranks of 4he police force on the other it has strengthened peoples poor Opinion of the police and further reduced its credibility entering the mischief-makers to take liberties with the law and order As result even the army which once evoked awe and fear amon is beginning to seem like yet another parading stunt of the government The frequent flag marches and deployment of the army in the so-called aid of civilian authorities do not have the desirable. effect much to the annoyance of senior army officials In the past communal violence was confined to the urban centres however after October 24 18 towns in various parts of the state had to be placed under indefinite curfew Violence in tribal belts of Banaskantha Panchmahals as well as South Gujarat is also new development that baffled the government and the police Though the administration has realised that these riots have not been caused by the traditional scapegoat bootleggers they have not yet taken cognisance of the slow but systematic pen of Hindu organisations into the tribal and rural areas Tribals attacking Muslim houses and forcing their families to flee may also have roots in the socio-political exploitation of the Adivasis But the immediate expression of their anthem minority community has essentially been aroused through subtle creation of Hindu consciousness among the tribals Equally surprising is the fact that women who until now were not target of communal frenzy are no longer spared After October 24 the casualty list shows significant rise in the number of schoolgoing girls and women stabbed to death in Ahmedabad as well as other parts of the state few cases of women committing violence is also new development for until now they were only used as shield against the police The police have also come across many cases of women carrying sharp. weapons for their protection suggesting that the women themselves have realised that they are no longer safe The Gujarat bandh on October 30 and the incidents thereafter are sorry commentary on the lack of foresight in the police force Having allowed the situation to worsen till late in the afternoon on the bandh day the police then put forward an excuse that the BJP leaders who had promised to Keep the affair peaceful one had gone back on their word When the frenzy was over in the first week of November the statewide violence had claimed 103 lives Of these 47 were in Ahmedabad alone The administrative ineptitude the police failure the political inaction combined to send wrong messages all around particularly to the minority community Therefore when the communal violence erupted again on the afternoon on December 9 the minority community was determined to show that it could not be taken for granted The latest spell of violence in the city that began on Sunday has almost taken on The form of triangular contest with the police also being attacked by members of both the communities Fortunately this phenomenon diminished after few days though the police became more like helpless referee as the members of the two communities fought pitched bloody street battles definite element of or discernible even if violence sparks off most spontaneously The large amount of acid bulbs rag bundles kerosene and country explosive materials used in the street fights suggest that this frenzy had been brewing for sometime at least Members of both communities seem prepared for all. eventualities while the intelligence sources of the government remained in the dark The use of private fire arms as well as the frightening form of masked opening indiscriminate fire in crowded places would suggest that it is new game in Gujarat Finally the two rounds of violence has brought about some new equations within the Hindu community While the 1985 riots saw the backward classes combine with the minority group in view of the antireservation agitations this time the Harijans and the other backward classes have joined forces with the main stream Hindu community Contrary to conventional wisdom that the Mandal controversy would have further deepened the chasm between the high-caste Hindus and the lower classes there seems to be coming together The backward classes became the victims. of the
