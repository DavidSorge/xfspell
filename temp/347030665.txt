In Perspective The Communal Monster By NANDAN KAGAL THE communal disturbances in Calcutta and in some other jars of West Bengal must shock his conscience of every Indian Partition riots showed that compassions can erupt into violence and make thousands of normally peaceful citizens commit the most chilling atrocities The hope that the massacres on both sides of the border in 1947 would have cathartic effect on Hindus and Muslims has been shattered most cruelly by the periodic communal riots in India and Pakistan in the past 16 years Jabalpur Aligarh Rajshahi Dacca and now Khulna Calcutta the list is painfully long The situation in Calcutta today is very tense indeed The only encouraging feature of the grim scene is that the Indian authorities are taking the sternest measures. to end the attacks on the minority community The military has been called out and the troops have orders to tire effectively without the slightest hesitation of anyone indulging in arson looting or murmischief Both the Union Home Minister and the Chief Minister of West Bengal have emphasized nothing that has happened on the other side of the border can justify the riots in Calcutta and in the districts of 24Parganas Nadia and Burdwan In Calcutta alone some 3000 persons have been taken into custody and round-the-clock curfew has been imposed on the city's nine disturbed areas Meanwhile opposition leaders in West Bengal have offered their fullest co-operation to the Government in the restoration of communal peace How soon Calcutta and the other affected parts of West Bengal will return to normal conditions remains to be seen but there can be no doubt in the minds of Indian Muslim citizens that the authorities are doing their best in very difficult situation SEQUENCE Though it cannot be emphasised enough that nothing that happens in Pakistan can ever justify attacks on Muslims in this country it is necessary to examine the sequence of events which led to the communal flare. up in West Bengal One wonders whether President Ayub Khan and other Pakistani leaders realise that they are in very real sense responsible for the communal disturbances in West Bengal These events. which must alarm anyone who wishes to ensure harmony between Hindu and Muslims would not have occurred but for the cynical way in which Pakistani leaders exploited the theft of the Prophets hair from the Hazratbal mosque in Srinagar in the last week of December Though the relic has now been replaced the mystery surrounding the Hazratbal affair has yet to be solved But while much remains obscure. about the theft and the subsequent recovery of the relic few things are fairly clear The thieves acted in way which was calculated to create serious difficulties for the Kashmir Government days hartal following the theft would have been perfectly understandable but life in Srinagar was paralysed for fully 10 days This would not have happened if disaffected elements in Srinagar had not. exploited the theft for political purposes AGENTS This is not to suggest that the theft was staged by Pakistani agents provocateur though it is true that there are any number of Pakistani agents in Srinagar some even masquerading as members of the National Conference But it surely stands to reason that no one who accepts India's stand on Kashmir and is favourably inclined towards the Kashmir Government could have had hand in the Hazratbal affair All communities in Kashmir and the rest of India were genuinely distressed over the theft yet members of the Ayub Khan Government and others. public figures in Pakistan proclaimed to their people that the theft was deliberate desecration of the mosque to wound the religious sentiments of Muslims on both sides of the border President Ayub. Khan himself went so far as to say that no Muslim could have committed the theft the implication being that the mischief was done by some unknown Hindu Pakistani press for its part launched veritable hate campaign addressing the public through screaming inflammatory headlines The result of such demagogy was felt in Khulna and several other parts of East Pakistan after several days of murderous attacks on the Hindu minority accompanied by arson and looting refugees began to cross over into the border districts of West Bengal and their arrival was almost immediately followed by retaliatory attacks on the Muslim minority in the 24 Parganas and Nadia Soon thereafter the mischief spread to Calcutta Communal violence has tendency to spread with frightening rapidity in chain reaction which becomes increasingly difficult to stop It is something to be grateful for that so far the Calcutta riots have not in turn provoked retaliatory attacks in Pakistan It is true that the present disturbances in West Bengal are reacting to the communal riots in Khulna and elsewhere in East Pakistan but when this is said it is worth remembering that on some occasions in the past the trouble began in India and subsequently spread to Pakistan In the face of these facts neither the people of India nor the people of Pakistan can claim to have clean hands While there is little to choose at the mass level between the majority communitys attitude to the main minority group in country the same surely cannot be said about the attitude of the two Governments Mr Nehrus Government has succeeded to remark a degree in making India1 secularism living reality The Union and State Government have consistently used their legal authority and their influence on public opinion to ensure for the Muslims and the other religion minorities equal rights and full sense of security Under Mr Nehrus leadership they have in deed leaned over backwards in an attempt to establish their bona fidesThe Union Government has for instance from pushing through any social legislation affecting India's Muslims though the need for some changes in Islamic personal law is felt by large section of thoughtful Muslims in the country No doubt many Indian Muslims feel that the benefits of secularism are restricted to upper class Muslim and that the majority of Muslim is getting less than fair deal But it is worth considering whether the disabilities felt by the Muslim workers and peasants and the Muslim middle class are not shared by members of all comma in India belonging to the responding economic groups 11 this is considered dispassionately one must surely conclude that the record of the Nehru Government on the communal front is on which no Indian need be ashamed of Canany Pakistani in all conscience say the same thing about own Government AGREEMENT The anatomy of communal violence being what it is neither Indie nor Pakistan can by itself prevent periodic Outbursts of violence against the main minority It was this led to the Nehru-Liaqat AI Agreement in April 1950 following communal disturbances on both sides of the border That document is well worth recalling today Governments of India and Pakistan solemnly agree that each shall ensure that throughout its territory complete equality of citizenship irrespective of religion full sense of security respect of life culture property and personal honour freedom of within each country and freedom of occupation speech and worship subject to law and morality Members of the shall have equal opportunity of the majority community to participate in the public life of their country to hold political or other office and to serve in their countrys civil and armed Both Governments declare these rights to be fundamental an undertake to enforce them effectively continued on Page 9 Column 1
