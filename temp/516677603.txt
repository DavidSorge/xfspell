Grim Centenary Bombay Riots In 1893 And Now By RAJDEEP SARDESAI riots in Bombay are an 1 unfortunate and tragic happening According to my own experience every community has its good and bad men Mohamand the Hindus are not worse than others Each religion has its own good moral effect on its followers In naff in ihn tc always one set of men who are fanatical 1 dont know how to describe it exactly whether they are Parsecs Hindus Christians or Muslims it doesn't matter Hindus and Muslims get on pretty well together normally There is no such thing as always hating each other These anguished words come not from those stunned by the recent violence in Bombay but from Dadabhai Naoroji the veteran nawho was responding to query by The Times of India shortly after Bombay had experienced its first major outbreak of HinduMuslim riots Turning the clock back 100 years to the grand old man of India suggests that however much we appear to move forward we can still be driven. back into medievalism Indeed looking into the mirror of history the image reflected by the 1893 riots is more than little disquieting Of course at the time Bombay with population of just under million was not an overgrown megapolis yet 1000 persons were killed and 50000 fled the city Indeed there are enough links between the past and the present to suggest that under the mask of the city cosmopolitanism has always lurked the ugly visage of violence Concerted Effort As now even then there was concerted effort to consolidate Hindu identity It was not Shri Ram kar seva but sabhas aimed at banning cow slaughter which sparked an aggressive Hindu resurgence Again the 1893 riots revealed the insecurity of the minorities and their susceptibility to the slightest provocation It was not the mahabut the playing of music on Fridays outside mosques in central Bombay that triggered off the trouble If reports from Ayodhya Surat and the December riots in Bombay have exacerbated tensions now tales of rioting in Saurashtras Prabhas-Pattan township invited backlash then The leadership of the two comtoons was as duplicitous in the 19th century as now in deliberately raising the ante The cow protection societies went about preaching the necessity of purchasing cows in order to prevent Muslims from slaughtering the animals The Muslims were given to understand that the Hindus were depriving them of their meat The 1893 riots paradoxically provided popular support for Lokmanya Tilaks valiant efforts to broaden the anti-British through the annual Gan pati celebrations In the process how ever they also weaned Hindus from participating in Moharrum Now as Bombay finds its own macabre way of observing centenary of riots it is more than likely that the divide between communities will deepen First the consolidation of Hindu identity 100 years ago was primarily directed at the enemy outside in the British Now the target of systematic campaign of hate is the alleged enemy within ie the anti-national Muslim Secondly what has happened in Bombay is not just another expression of communal frenzy It reflects highly organized effort by vested interests to bring the edifice of secular and republican India to breaking-point In 1893 when the high priests of command their debut they had few allies In todays urbanised milieu they have found conspirators in slumlords criminals and venal politicians Failure Exposed Thirdly the riots have exposed the utter failure of the government as an instrument of social order There was no Laloo Prasad Yadav who could park himself in Sitamarhi for three days to bring the riots under control Mr Sudhakar Naik preferred to remain cooped up in his bungalow even as the Prime Minister Mr PV Narasimha Rao engaged in tokenism. by paying half-day visit to the city Interestingly letter written to The Times of India shortly after the 1893 riots had caustically remarked it is to be noted that the local leadership was conspicuous by its absence from the bazaar during the days of rioting Today the main voice heard in the bazaar is the communal diatribe of the Shiv Sena chief Mr Bal Thackeray Indeed the response of the so-called secular class has been pathetic In contrast to the unity of the saffron brigade note how Mr Advani studiously refused to condemn the Shiv Sena the secular leadership was hopelessly divided over whether the chief minister should go or an emergency be declared Moreover the city's working class is now totally disjointed after the collapse of the textile strike in the mid-1980s and could not even react sharply to reports that employees from the minority community were being singled out at the workplace Worse event Dalits and women who have been victims of the Hindutva brigade have now joined hands with their one-time oppressors Fourthly the role of the police as an impartial force has now come under the microscope In 1893 the then police commissioner Mr Vincent was stoned by mob This time too there was petrol bomb attack on the police commissioner Mr Bapat The difference is that the hostility towards the police 100 1 years ago was largely because it was seen to be part of the colonial establishment Today the loss of faith is 1 all-encompassing and stems from the belief that the men in khaki have turned saffron especially at the lower level Worse deliberate attempt is being made by few anti-social elements to demoralise the police by 1 targeting them BJPs Turn Finally the process of legitimate forces of fascism has 1 continued apace If the Congress snuggled up to the Shiv Sena in the 1970s it is now the BJPs turn to tapdance with it The middle class and the intellectual elite have also joined in the lumpen chorus by acquiescing in and even tacitly endorsing the violence that has now even reached their affluent neighbourhoods It is this legitimisation of violence that must be tackled on priority basis At one level it is necessary to look at law and order problem The judicial inquiry must ensure that it is not bogged down in bureaucratic wrangles If as in the case of the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi the culprits are not booked or as in the Bhiwandi riots in 1984 where just one of the 962 accused was convicted it will only give the guilty licence to kill at another level frontal political offensive against communalists of all faiths. imperative If soft state believes that mere phone call to Mr Thackeray is enough to stop him 1 making inflammatory statements or if the Naib Imams appeal to Muslims to take up arms is not outrightly condemned then the orgy of violence will continue at third level it is absolutely vital that movement based on clearcut secular principles is fostered at the grassroots If the Shiv Sena can have 221 in every ward there is no reason why an equal number of peace forums cannot be set up in the same areas Indeed even if public confidence in the state apparatus is at its lowest ebb there is still not of hope in the thousands of people who sheltered their neighbours set up refugee camps and generously donated food and clothing as Dadabhai Naoroji once said there are good and bad men in every community It is time that all good men stood up to be counted
