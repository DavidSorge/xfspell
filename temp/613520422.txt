the city is arbitrary and illegal the Bombay city civil and sessions court has held Despite the government's protestations to the contrary of illegal structures in Bombay was nothing but an Open invitation to land grabbers to seize public property belonging to citizens and with impunity Judge Gupta said in his 55-page order The government had the right to grant land to certain categories of people on specific terms and conditions the order said But this right did not include the blanket power to legalise all encroachments If this was being done it was not sustainable under the law added The issue arose out of suit filed by Sayyed Zuber Hyder Akbar Miya who has 20 by 30 structures at Azad Nagar Hill No 4 Ghatkopar He was asked by the Bombay municipal corporation to demolish it since it was Sayyed Miya conceded that he began occupying the land question without title since he found it vacant Yet he resisted demolition on the extraordinary pound that there was a policy of the government authorising such unauthorised habitation and that he was entitled to take advantage of such policy question arises as to whenhow ny by whom and under what power such decision or policy there be any was framed Judge Gupta said He approvingly quoted Mr Justice Shared Manohar of the election Dealing with an affidavit filed by Mr Afelpurkar then secretary of the housing and special assistance department the judge said it was difficult to avoid the impression At the government was attempting to hide something Judge Gupta noted that the afwar filed reluctantly and only Bombay high court who heard an appeal in the suit earlier The high court judge said public lands could not be gifted away by the government to grabbers and enjoy particular act was wrong till particular date the same could be converted into rightful thing by its restrospective reg-rejecting Sayyed Mjyas suit Judge Gupta asked how the government could legalise structures from time to time which by coincidence always happened to be prior to or immediately after each assembly after Mr Justice Manohar passed the following order during the hearing of the appeal If an affidavit is not filed it will be presumed that the government is attempting to hide something from the court and in that event appropriate proceeding including contempt proceedings be taken against the secretary concerned One hand the affidavit stated that the government did not have policy of regularizing illegal structures on government land that had come up till August 1988 Judge Gupta stated But in the same breath the secretary also mentioned that hutments censused in 1976 woe being protected Identity cardi and photo passes were issued as basic amenities If the government wanted the land back the slumwellers were provided alternate accommodation The judge sought to know the legal basis on which this was done He asked whether any government resolution had been passed in 1976 stating the policy on the matter and why it had not been produced before the court His order also mentioned that the authorities were 1986 resolution to justify the region ten years earlier The governments step in 1976 was capricious and arbitrary and would not withstand judicial scrutiny the order said The affidavit stated that slums that had come up after 1976 but prior to 1980 were also given protection by decision. taken by the then chief minister who was conveyed to the press on October 28 1985 Judge Gupta doubted whether the chief minister could independently take such decision which adversely affected state property He also wondered whether an announcement in the press could amount to granting legal rights to third parties binding on the government and in manner justifiable in law The judge said# any decision no department not shown to have been expressed to have been made in the name of the governor and not signed by an officer specifically empowered was bad in law inoperative and ultra vires of the Maharashtra government rules of business The order also referred to January 27 1989 government resolution giving protection to hutments that had come up between 1980 and 1985# The judge noted that while Mr Afzalpurkars August 9 1988 affiliated that no protection would be given to post-1980 hutments the government1 had its stand in five months He added that no compelling reasons were given for doing so Mr Justice Manohar had noted while hearing the appeal that the court had come across declarations that illegal hutments built on government-or municipal land were regard that the dateline had been advanced from 1980 to 1982 and then 1986 The judge said the government should come out with firm stand announcements If the government had in fact legalized the structures direct question arose as to under which law it did so Under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966 and the rates filmed under the government has United power to give away land to some categories of people However This power was subject to the planning-authority under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Aa to remove all unauthorised structures the judge held Even Under the revenue code he said government actions were subject to the rates framed under section 51 and priorities laid down in them Town planning laws had been framed in the interest of public health and taken any steps that would defeat the spirit of these Us The decision to regularise from 1976 onwards was therefore ultra vim into Gupta White the appeal Mr Justice Manohar had said that some day the high court would have to go into the question of Miya has challenged Judge Gupta order in the superior court What the high court will say on this important issue of public policy is being keenly looked forward to Bhagalpur tense TheTtaetof
