Fire destroys 30 Ghatkopar godowns By The Times Team BOMBAY December 9 AbALhA village in was today engulfed by smoke which could be seen as far away as Chembur and Kurla hill in this village stock Old paper and jute bags were destroyed in the spreading inferno The police and few residents of the area said the blaze was caused by people hurling petrol bombs at the godowns from the top of the hill No one could accurately say which community had sparked off the fires though ironically the property of both the communities Hindus and Muslims were destroyed in the process according to local residents Rather than blaming either community the residents directed their anger against the police and fire brigade officials whom according to them appeared to be delaying action to control the situation We have been calling for the fire engines to rush for the past two hours and they have only just arrived complained Hamid young man Five policemen positioned themselves outside the burning godowns and watched them being eaten away by the flames Said police officer We cannot do anything about it because they are attacking from him When we go up they disappear making it difficult for us to catch them We are small number thus making us vulnerable to attack said policeman Another reason why they hesitated to nab the culprits was because while they police were on the Saki Naka police station zone while the arsonists on the other hand were in the Ghatkopar police station area So it is not our lookout said cop Firemen said that the arsonists were preventing even the fire engines from extinguishing the flames by hurling stones At one point firemen asked the Times Team to request the cops outside to provide security cover to the fire brigade staff It was only after two hours after the fire started that fire engines make their way to the affected area and began operations However they seemed to face shortage of water Watching the godowns go up inflames was Mr. Chaganlal Daniji Bhanusali their owner People have been throwing petrol bombs for the last two hours and no one seems to be controlling them he He stated that the godowns had been there for the last. five years and they mainly contained gunny bags and scrap worth between Rs 5 and 6 lakhs The fire was primarily in two areas While parts of residential area were gutted on the other side, the godowns were destroyed On account of the narrow width of the road fire engines had difficult time gaining access to the slum colony part of it which was being turned into ashes by the fire resident Mr LT. Bhanusali said he had been residing in the colony for the last 21 years and this was the first time it had been attacked by stones by miscreants. This morning's arson seemed clear example of how miscreants incite communal passions where two communities have lived in harmony for years Child in firms woman
