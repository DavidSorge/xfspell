Ahmedabacks Gory Message Perils Of Bad Old Ways By MALHOTRA BY now it should be clear that in Gujarat even the reservation issue has receded into the background having been engulfed by the orgy of violence arson and lawlessness that it triggered in the first place The primary problem now is the virtual collapse of the civil administration especially in Ahmedabad never mind the euphemism that the army has been called out in this burning city in aid of civil authority Such situations have not been unknown in the past But the revolt in the midst of caste carnage by section of the Ahmedabad which then went on rampage putting to the torch offices of newspapers whose accounts of alleged police excesses it did not care for has added grave new dimensions to the total disorder that has overtaken the city of Mahatma Gandhi The questions that this frightening state of affairs raises are as numerous as they are painful Some at least need to be faced squarely and without delay The first and foremost of these questions is how long and how often will we go on calling out the army to assist civil authority to preserve or restore order Of course it is the duty of the armed forces respond to all such calls by duly constituted governments at the Centre and in the states But much too frequent and often much too prolonged use of the army which is defense service usually required for the purpose of this secondary duty is fraught with dangers too obvious to need spelling out The weapon of the last resort cannot by debe taken recourse to lightly No wonder then that theory everyone agrees that the calling out of the army ought to be an exception rather than the rule In practice however things are the other way round According to available statistics during the two. decades 1951-1970 the army was deployed in aid of civil power on 476 occasions During the last ten years alone however this has happened no fewer than 374 times Not judging by what is going on in Ahmedabad Baroda and other places in anything show that the trend can be reverted easily or quickly For the steady erosion of the Indian republics infra-structure the police the para-military organisations the civilian bureaucracy and so on has played such havoc that the normal instruments of governance are hard put to perform adequately even their daily chores leave alone coping with conflicts of extreme gravity Consequently in times of crises the civil administration fails and in the event of such failure there is nothing to do except to send an SOS to the army Deadly Cancer. After last year's traumatic events in Punjab and even before Mrs Gandhi's brutal assassination there were enough indications that the Central government at least had woken up to the dangers and was taking steps to streamline and revitalise the civil administration the police and the para-military organisations immediately after succeeding his mother Mr Rajiv Gandhi spoke more refreshingly and reassuringly on this subject But evidently the situation on the ground has not changed between words and deeds there continues to fall the proverbial shadow What has brought the police force all over the country to the present Jony pass with its morale discipline and cohesion gone to the dogs and its image tarnished is no secret Cynical and reckless politicisation of the police has long been identified as the principal cause of the malaise and this has been discussed threadbare There are other problems no doubt and some of these are serious For instance the pay of the policemen pathetic and all attempts to get it raised to the level of say what sweeper gets any public undertaking have failed The working and living conditions of most policemen especially in major cities pitiable Often they and their families live in slums in close proximity to smugglers bootleggers tough and criminals whom they are supposed to apprehend Rare is policeman who gets day off There is also what so respected retired police officer as Mr Rustam ji calls the great and growing gap between officers and men On the other hand if policemen are forced to work in conditions that are brutalising there is little reluctance on the part of even well-looked-after policemen to be brutal deaths in custody torture of suspects rape of even minor girls and so on speak for themselves Corruption in the police has become something of cancer without cure Ana since the armed battalions are the only ones which have no opportunity to make fast buck by fleecing the public the crowning. irony is that only those officers who are adjudged to be inept or have fallen from grace are deputed to lead the armed constabulary Suicidal Course However when all is said and done the fact remains. that nothing has sapped the vitality of the police more than the relentless and remorseless attempt by governments of all political hues to bend it to their narrow partisan and often unworthy ends. Transfers frequently at the behest of local politicos or gangland bosses have been used as powerful instrument to cow down those who might otherwise have remained straightforward and acted. professionally accelerated promotions and other favours bestowed on the pliable and the sycophant also have had their demonstrative effect Ironically what the politicians have done to the police not without cooperation from some at least of the top police officers is underscored also by the curious treatment meted out to the country's first and so far only national police headed by Mr Dharma Vira and appointed by the Janata government The commission work was still incomplete though it had by then submitted several reports when Mrs Gandhi returned to power in January 1980 For while the commission was allowed to continue but thereafter pressure was mounted on it to wind up its work Its reports were decried as biased and if not exactly thrown into the dustbin were consigned to dusty. pigeonhole Unfortunately all this happened in spite of the fact that the commission had made many useful and unexceptionable recommendations including the one for the appointment in each state of state security commission to take care of the scourge of politicisation It is time that the commissions wholesome reports are rescued from whichever dark corner of the archives they are languishing in and acted upon For if the current catastrophe in Gujarat has any meaning it is that the long over due task of reforming the police cannot be delayed any longer To persist in the bad old ways and thus let Ahmedabad's example become contagious would be nothing short of suicidal Of course it goes without saying that what applies to the police applies also to the civil service and para-military forces Indeed the state of the para-military forces especially the Central Reserve Police force CRPF merits particular attention This is so because the CRPF is vastly 1 over-stretched from Amritsar Agartala and Kargil to Kottayam It is also grossly overworked So much so that for some years it has had no time for essential training rotation rest and refresher courses Calling Halt There are two. other features of the grim situation in Gujarat which cannot be brushed under the carpet The first is the conduct of the Solanki government and the second that of its opponents and others The issue of reservations especially for the so-called backward castes as distinct from the schecastes and the scheduled tribes are both complex and emotive Only by an all-party consensus can sane solution of this vexed problem be found For the present the pertinent point is that the Solanki government patently played politics with the reservation issue when on the eve of the state assembly elections it invoked The long-neglected Rane commissions report consists increase the proportion of jobs reserved for backward classes The ploy did yield electoral dividends But as subsequent events have shown victory at the polls are not enough and the state governments subsequent action in first staying the enhanced reservation and then capitulating to all the demands of the antireservation agitation only compounds its original sin 1 But if the Gujarat chief minister and his colleagues have been guilty of both political chicanery and pusillanimity his critics and 5 opponents have been even more culpable They have not hesitated to play with innocent lives to promote their partisan end of worsting Mr Solanki something they could not do at the hustings The dangerous game goes on with no sign of construction intervention by central leaders of the parties which have converted Ahmedabad into virtual inferno There is inactivity also on the part of the Central government even though there is danger that unless halt is put to it at once the agitation in Gujarat might spill over the state ries In this connection it may be 1 asked with all due respect whether the courts were right in intervening highly explosive and fast changing situation in the 1 manner in which they did It was in the course of ensuring that 1 directive of the Gujarat high court was carried out that head constable was savagely done to death and vicious chain reaction touched off The high court has since deferred the enforcement of its order to later date But civil court in Baroda has deemed it fit to issue an ex- parte directive to the police commissioner and other police personnel not to enter several areas of the city
