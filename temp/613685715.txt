Viewing secularism after Pune By The Times of India News Service PUNE May 6 secular political parties will be able to do much soul-searching after what the residents of Pune went through during the past fortnights tension It will be futile to explain away the incidents even if there was no loss of life and the damage to property public or private was negligible The trouble started on the night of April 1 8 when some miscreants tried to disrupt the Shiv Jayanti procession Reactions were sharp and the police promptly imposed night curfew There were attacks on individuals and shops Text six days Then peace reigned for about five days but on April 30 an attempt to desecrate Lord Ganapatis idol in temple is the busy Budhwar Chowk area was made by 32-year-old man OUTRAGED DEVOTEES Ganapati being the beloved deity of Maharashtra thousands of outraged devotees collected near the temple had the police not acted quickly and imposed 48-hour curfew the city would have been torn with serious rioting Leaders of political parties preaching secularism failed miserably to pacify the people The citizens could not have faced the agitated youths without the help of the police On the next four days there were several incidents of burning of shops attempts to damage places of worship and stone-throwing Neither the party leaders nor their active workers could do anything to stop this. This calls for introspection by the parties the Congress which has the highest number of elected representatives in the city The fortnight's happenings have indeed proved that Pune is leaderless city This introspection is necessary because the issue is not restricted to Pune city alone. At all the major centres in the district bands were organised as in Pune The desecration incident will have far- reaching repercussions throughout the state and communal forces are bound to take advantage of the atmosphere thus created It is difficult to say at this juncture whether it was the Shiv Sena or the Path Pavan Sanghatana or the BJP that kindled the communal tension The Ganapati temple selected by the miscreant for desecration is controlled by Congress activists Sometime back the temple trustees had organised programmes to promote national integration This year the trust took out the Shiv Jayanti processions and ended them early to avoid trouble during night hours SILENCE 1 The RSS chief Mr. Balasaheb Deoras visited the temple two days after the incident throughout the day he did not utter single word about the desecration However the BJP leaders reportedly grew restless at his silence at about 1 0 pm the present and the former BJP MLAs rushed to newspaper offices with the RSS chief statement saying that he had condemned the event In recent times the Shiv Sena has been making inroads in interior Maharashtra After capturing Bombay and Thane municipal corporations the Sena flag has been hoisted on the Aurangabad corporation In Pune district alone the Sena has 600 branches growing influence of organisations like the Shiv Sena Patit Pavan Sanghatana and Hindu Ekata Andolan might be very small extent due to the intellectually bankruptcy among the state Congress leaders who are engaged in factionalism despite serious threat to their existence The youth the Congress because according to them it is trying to appease the Muslims The Shiv Sena got real boost everywhere after the Supreme Court judgement in the Shah Bano case when Muslim fundamental organisations launched virulent campaign against it The Shiv Sena stepped up its activities at this opportune moment and declared itself the only protector of Hindus Pune communal tension leaves behind two questions unanswered Why should person from particular community commit such an act of desecration Shouldnt man of that age be fully aware of the perilous consequences of his act on the members of his community DARING ACT It certainty is daring act as he did it in daylight in busy locality and did not bring any vehicle to run away in after the outrage Most people here ridicule the contention of very senior police official who after day's visit said that was thrown by the culprits friends challenging him to flying dirt at the idol was the reason behind the act Another question is which are the forces behind the miscreants who created trouble during the Shiv Jayanti procession and the person allegedly involved in the desecration attempt It is for the intelligence department to find out whether communal or J Hindu Muslim or both engineered the trouble
