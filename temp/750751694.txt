Indore riots reveal govt apathy By ANIL SHARMA The Times of India News Service INDORE October 16 DEATH and destruction has put this city on the map of communal violence-prone cities in the country The elements of communal frenzy that are an inevitable part of the chain of events were repeated in their bizarre here There was religious procession there were pious declarations of good behaviour and communal harmony and there was the administration misplaced over-confidence that it was fully prepared to meet the situation After all said the district collector Mr Bhagirath Prasad We had -deployed 18 magistrates in the city when the religious procession was taken out and we had written undertaking from the organizers of the procession that they would not carry arms and there would be no provocative slogans But all this means virtually nothing for the kin of the dead and the people who have been maimed in the violence Their names now really do not matter Among the dead could be Altaf Hussain or an Om Prakash Among the injured there could be Hemant Sharma or Masroor AH It really does not matter as the injured wail in agony at the Maharaja Yashwant Hospital all the assurances and precautions of the state government mean nothing to them The tales that emerge from these sick beds reveal the gross failure of the administration in coming to terms with grim situation Mr. Bhagirath Prasad himself admitted that there was tension in the city after the Ram Shila pooja But we thought that if the procession is allowed then the simmering tension between the two communities. will be defused We did not expect that the result would be so bad he said But almost everyone here felt that the situation had reached flashpoint though no one in the administration really cared There is also the policy of the state government to treat all communities on par and when the Ram Shila pooja procession was allowed we thought that the Milad-Eunnabi procession should also be allowed said Mr Prasad This innocence of the administration has cost the city dearly There is colony in this city called Zabran colony named so because it came into existence by the force of encroachment More than 100 hutments in this colony have been reduced to ashes The people have fled the area and in the house of Kalilbhai the women are so scared that they start screaming when there is knock on the door We. just do not know where our menfolk are said Sarabee clutching three-year-old son with fear writ large in her eyes Yet sub-inspector posted at Zabran colony said it was from the house of Katilbhai that several arms were recovered This inspector also explained about the preparations that had gone into these riots Countrybomb or petrol bomb are not easy to make and it required lots of time but these houses were full of it he said There is considerable anger in both the communities against the police force Hiralal Soni jeweller in the Jawahar Marg area whose house was the target of processionists. said the police just fled the spot He said the rioters entered his house and looted cash and jewellery AH the things that were in our house have been looted he said In the same area living about 20 yards off the main road in the Bhama family The family members said that the rioters entered their house burnt moped and decamped with cash and ornaments There is no dearth of such tales in this city Official estimates of the losses in the riots from arson and looting have been placed at Rs 50 lakhs but former minister Mr Rameshwar Patel who was an eyewitness to the start of the incidents put the damage above Rs 1 crore The number of burnt vehicles itself could be more than 300 Many citizens felt that there was no protection to life and property There are allegations that the police virtually helped the riots But some policemen were also injured Mr Vijaypal Singh who sustained head injury and was admitted to hospital said that he was struck by soft drink bottle and stone The response of The administration to the entire episode can be gauged from just one gesture The home minister Mr Jaipal Singh who was at his home district Panna when the riots broke out on Saturday came to this city this morning after detour to New Delhi tie took round of the city and then had his lunch at the residency But he could not afford to miss his afternoon 1 siesta Even as the city was tense and 1 there were some incidents of violence Mr Singh went off to sleep for 45 minutes His special assistant Mr Dube said Sahib khana so rahe hain Mein gaya tha par wok nahin Lagta hain gehri mein hain Sahib had his lunch and went to sleep tried to wake him up but failed It seems he is sleeping soundly This response perhaps symbolises the state of the administration Everyone was aware that there could be tension and the procession would spell disaster So what else could one expect except death and destruction
