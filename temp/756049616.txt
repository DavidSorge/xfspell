Gujarat riots caught govt napping ANALYSIS The Times of India News Service AHMEDABAD April 27 GUJARAT seems to be heading for yet another spell of communal turmoil is the present trend of communal riots is any indication whether old design or cointhe communal violence has spread with precision from Surat to Baroda to Ankleshwar within five days like wild fire and the riots have been raging without noticeable abatement Worse still the state administration and the law-enforcing agencies have been apprehensive of communal violence spreading to other areas in view of the surcharge atmosphere But the most puzzling aspect of the rioting has been the clock-like precision of incidents Surat witnessed communal carnage on Saturday and Sunday and Baroda on Monday and Tuesday. to keep the sequence of the calendar Ankleshwar fell to rioters on Wednesday and Thursday Many areas in these three towns are still under curfew Frequent outbursts of group clashes have become common. despite the deployment of police contingents The chief minister Mr Chimanbhai Pate who publicly blamed the intelligence wings of the police for their failure to gauge the situation was himself surprised by the speed with which the riots spread from one area to another and from one city to another city In just five days 90 incidents of rioting were reported from Surat Baroda and Ankleshwar. accounting for more than 15 deaths Over SO people were injured in police firing or group clashes and about 100 shops and houses were set on fire resulting in losses running into lakhs or rupees Apparently the government machinery has been caught napping by the sudden spurt of riots in candid confession before journalists the other day Mr Patch said he was at his wits end to ascertain how the police had failed to act promptly when signals were loud and clear right from the beginning However the chief minister cannot escape his responsibility by passing the back on to the police One wonders why he failed to take prompt action when he was reportedly warned by intelligence agencies about the impending communal riots Just claiming that he will not allow the elections to be vitiated by communal elements out to extract political mileage from the riots will not suffice The chief minister has failed on the law-and-order front whenever the state was engulfed by communal incidents in his first ten months from April to December 1990 the state witnessed nearly 1400 communal incidents resulting in the death of 224 people and injuries to 775 Instead of admitting his failure to chief minister used to point an accusing finger at the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP even when it was coalition partner in his ministry But how does one explain more than 120 communal riots from January to April 1991 when 38 people were killed and 170 injured Despite the use and misuse of TADA and other draconian laws the chief minister has not been able to contain the communal cancer from spreading He hasnt found time to visit any of the riotravaged cities either though he flies off to Delhi on the slightest pretext The continuing tension is bound to vitiate the election atmosphere and will have farreaching impact on the outcome of the poll In the past communal forces gained tremendously in the Lok Sabha and the subsequent assembly elections by keeping the communal pot boiling It is also puzzling that the communal riots so far have been confined to constituencies where the Congress has pitted its candidates against the BJP whether it is Surat city Baroda or Broach district before it is too late the chief minister should act firmly to nip the communal force in the bud Otherwise the coming election may prove to be bloody
