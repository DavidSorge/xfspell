Errant cops and erroneous cases By NARESH FERNANDES and MANJULA SEN BOMBAY Jan 28 TN their enthusiasm to book ofduring the riots that continue the city last fortnight the city police have filed legal  riddled with anomalies of logic and consistency Besides resulting in innocent Ibe harassed these flaws will allow several genuine offenders to get off free maintain city lawyers There is little connection between the first information reports FIRs filed by the police and the charges on which people 1 have been held alleged Mr Colin Gonsalves lawyer and civil rights activist The guilty will get away because they have been arrested along with so many innocent people maintained Mr Majeed Memon who is also assisting riot victims Most cases will be discharged because there is no direct. evidence linking the offenders with the crimes of which they have been accused Because of these irregularities several offenders who have been charged with murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code IPC have been granted bail though at most times the offence is non-bailable, he said. Among the more interesting inconsistencies is the case of 56 residents of the Bombay dock labour board colony at Cotton Green who on January 10 were charged with rioting with deadly weapons after forming and joining an unlawful assembly with common intention to cause harm to shop vehicles and to property to insult the religious feelings of other communities causing grievous hurt to members of the public and public servants arson looting etc The 56 people have also been charged with murder. However according to the FIR crime record 1593# filed by constable of Kalachowkie police station only nine people were injured in the incident all in police firing The FIR lists properly damaged as not yet known and does not speak of any deaths In another case registered in Mahim on January 7 23 persons were arrested for among other things murdered and for attacking the police Interestingly though most people who were said to constitute the mob belonged to the minority community Shiv Sena corporator Mr Milind Vaidya and few other members of the majority community are also accused of participating in these actions What better instance of national integration could there be than this asked Mr Memon cynically It is inconceivable that members of both communities formed the same mob All the accused in this case based on an FIR filed by Mahim sub-inspector were let off on negligible bail of Rs 950 for an offence of which the courts would usually take more serious views he said The courts were also inclined to take lenient view of the accused in case CR 4393 filed at Nirmal Nagar police station on January 15 against 4000 to 5000 Muslim rioters for several offences after the Friday named at Behrampada The FIR filed by sub-inspector of Nirmal Nagar police station Mr Sarolkar states that the riot started at 145 pm precisely the time that the namaz was being performed according to Mr Memon. The court recognised that the 4000 people who had assembled for Namaz could not be termed an unlawful assembly and that there was an inconsistency in the timing stated in the FIR said Mr Memon Despite being charged under Section 307 for attempted murder the court let the accused off on nominal bail of Rs 1200 Legal rights activists alleged that the police could be faulted with more than mere haste. or enthusiasm in the matter of the slip-shot FIRs Several victims of police assault are being faced with fabricated charges to cover up for the fact that police brutality has been extensive maintained Mr Gonsalves What better way for them to justify having to open fire than to claim that they had been attacked Faced with these accusations the joint police commissioner Mr Tyagi said that the claims of police excesses were unjustified He said that while he had no personal knowledge of accused persons being let off on bail because of faulty FIRs were bound to occur in riot situations riot means lot of confusion There is minimal staff at the police station so paper work may not be clear he explained However he maintained that anomalies were not likely if FIRs had been filed by policemen
