By LAW KUMAR MISHRA The Times of India News Service PAIN October II THE Silamari communal riots in which 38 people were killed last week has exposed the chief minister Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav who used to claim he had given an administration free of communal tension The Silamarhi communal is not the first incident of sizable dimensions since Mr Yadav took over as the chief minister in March 1 990 He started his innings with major communal violence in the state capital itself when officially 18 people were killed in riots which rocked the capital for fortnight along with Silamarhi communal riots broke out ai Hilsa 40 kms from here between Patna Silamarhi and Hilsa the state has witnessed communal riots at Ranchi Salbarwa in Palamu district twice in Nawadah district Paknwaravan Chakradharpur near Jamshcdpur Arrah Darbhanga and Dhanbad According to the chairman of the Stale Minorities Commission Prof Jabir Hussain at these places the casualty was low and these were# overshadowed by the 1989 Bhagalpur riots which look place couple of months before Mr Yadav came to power The administration and the leaders of all political parties admit Silamari was communal riot and not caste riot as claimed by the chief minister who told the BBC and the local press that the riots had been engineered by Bhumihars Brahmins and Raall forward castes according to the Mandal. commission definition Mr Yadav attempt to Manthe communal riot could not find favour from his supporters in the Janata Dal and also the government Mr Raghunath Jha MLA of Sitamarhi and president of the state unit of the JP alleged even people belonging to backward cases including Yadava invaded the colonies of the Muslims The role of the leaders of Sitamarhi during the riots also needs probe The former Union minister of state for external affairs and local MP Mr Hankishorc Singh is under cloud to his dubious role in his constituency during the immersion of the idols of Durga and others Me reached Silamarhi in the middle of the night and he is alleged to have provoked the prolo pass through the unauthorised route Flynn of the procession through the Masjid Road led to riots on October 6 and what started at Sitamarhi town at 4 am soon spread lo dozen neighbouring villages in iwo blocks Riga and Majorganj The former Union minister mysteriously disappeared from his constituency reappeared at Delhi to address press conference as party spokesman and charged the Congress and the SJP and BJP with starting riots That the chief minister is losing the grip over administration is apparent from the fact that he had to camp in the riot-hi area for days together with his entire team of police and top civil officials including the chief secretary and the director-general of police lo control the riots He could succeed in four days The Centre acted promptly and rushed seven companies of the just launched Rapid Action Force Silamarhi being the first beneficiary of the force district administration's failure in preventing the riots from spreading to the rural areas has embarrassed the chief minister who had declared that the pact of Maya Muslims and Yadavas was intact during his rule Small huts of many Muslims in the villages were raided by the anti-socials and set fire Mr Yadav had triumphantly declared on the first day nothing has happened just one person died However the next day figure rose to 16 and on the third day it was 38 The district administration was obviously not alive to the growing sensitiveness in the district and it failed in suppressing the riots in the villages where 26 people were killed compared to 12 in the disheadquarters The Silamarhi riot has yet another distinctive feature It is probably for its first time that an accusing linger has not been pointed to the RSS or the Vishwa Hindu Panshad The chief minister has called declared that no political parliament was behind the Rather there are charges levelled against the local Janata Dal MP and MLA by the ruling party leaders and some of them have even demanded arrest of the MP and others Bihar has witnessed dozen communal riots during Mr Yadavs tenure and in none of the cases the SP or the DM has been touched The minorities commission chairman inon the part of the government whether lo sack or transfer the SP or the DM has led to massacre In the instant case of Silamarhi Mr Yadav was seen functioning like policeman with torch and stick in his hand He was trying to fill in the ineffectiveness of his police and civil officers who feel they were ineffective because the subordinate officers like the -inof the police stations and the blocks were ignoring their orders Posting of officers in the districts in Bihar is done by the chief minister and not by the DIGs or collectors The subordinate officers feel closer to the ministers than their immediate bosses in the districts This happened in Sitamarhi too Mr Yadav claims there is move to destabilise his well established and popular government One of his supporters compares the dein Sitamarhi with Jamshcdpur riots of 1979 and Bhagalpur riots of 1989 which led to collapse of Mr Karpoori Thakur and Mr Satyndra Narayan Sinhas governments But in Sitamarhi the saboteurs arc from within the Janata Dal
