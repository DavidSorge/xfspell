final announcement on the plan of action joint delegation of Muslim leaders lodged protest with the President against the damage to the disputed structure at Ayodhya and said the entire Muslim community had lost confidence in the Prime Minister at Ayodhya the police were nervously patrolling the bylanes The huge crowd of kar sevaks were in defiant mood as they went about setting houses on fire The VHP-RSS-BJP leaders were repeatedly urging the kar sevaks not to leave the area but nobody listened to them The mood was tense From early morning today sants and sadhus had gathered at the platform next to the shilanyas site They were sitting on the ground and were being recited Volunteers of the RSS in their distinctive uniforms outnumbered the police It all started at Ayodhya with the arrival of the leaders The first to arrive was the VHP general secretary Mr Ashok Singhal Later the BJP leaders Mr Advani and Dr Murli Manohar Joshi also arrived The kar sevaks They rushed to the disputed site and tried to get in 35 minutes before the kar seva was to start at 1215 pm There was much pushing and jostling and finally bunch of kar seva's managed to get inside the disputed site They were immediately surrounded by RSS volunteers and sadhus The sadhus tried their best to pacify them urging them to go back Some RSS volunteers tried to muscle them out But they stood their ground This went on for some time and suddenly group of about 30 men in yellow headbands descended on the errant kar sevaks They managed to physically remove them But the whole operation backfired as the kar sevaks were enraged There was more pushing and jostling Finally around 1 140 am six kar sevaks managed to break the cordon again from the south side of the shrine As soon as they got into the dispute area they tried to enter the shrine which was surrounded by one company of CRPF troops These men chased the kar sevaks who retaliated by throwing stones After that the kar sevaks swamped into the disputed area and tried to get into the shrine All hell suddenly broke loose Even as leaders urged the kar sevaks over loud speakers they had already broken inside the shrine The CRPF men stood their ground for about 20 minutes but they soon had to run for their lives Then two kar sevaks could be seen on top of the dome waving saffron flags Once the CRPF men had fled there was nobody to stop deluge of kar sevaks entering the shrine The UP police did not even attempt to stop them Most of them looked embarrassed as the kar sevaks shouted PAC zindabad Soon hundreds of kar sevaks could be seen all over the shrine The CRPF men later said there was no magistrate inside the shrine All the kar sevaks were hitting the structure with spades axes and rods Within minutes stones were uprooted from the dome and below to the kar sevaks were cutting away the walls The VHP-BJP-RSS leaders continued to plead with the kar sevaks to stop They continued to plead till 1230 pm and then abruptly stopped more than an hour after the kar sevaks had stormed the shrine the district magistrate Mr Srivastava decided the situation had gone out of control He sent note to the DIG CRPF who is in command of the Central forces here He asked for the forces to come to the disputed site Without any loss of time four companies of the CRPF and the elite Rapid Action Force were dispatched from Faizabad But The kar sevaks had blocked the road in many places Bricks stones and trees were lying on the road making it difficult for the forces to reach Ayodhya Within half an hour the forces had reached Saket College who is kilometre away from the shrine Here they were stopped by another magistrate The officers leading the forces were asked to go back to Faizabad because the approach road to the shrine was blocked Back at the shrine things were getting uglier Presspersons and lensemen were beaten up and many of their cameras were snatched But the foreign correspondents got worse deal It seems the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC had shown clip on the Ayodhya issue with footage of the 1990 incident The kar sevaks thought it was the coverage of the current kar seva Dst fore8n were surrounded with shouts of BBC hai hai They were beaten up despite their protests Many camera teams saw their expensive equipment smashed Many of the journalists had to seek shelter at an adjacent building where most of the UP police personnel too were standing By now the kar sevaks were at the 277-acre disputed site Many of them were seen on rooftop around the shrine singing Ram As the pitch of the kirten went higher so did the frenzy The steel fences running all around the shrine had been uprooted and were being used for demolition There was frantic activity Huge stones that had been uprooted were rolling down the wall And many of them hit the kar sevaks Those injured were rushed to the nearby ashrams for first aid Many of them were injured seriously One sadhu could be seen lying on the ground The stomach cut open RSS volunteers said more than 100 had received injuries Many of them were in serious condition Three or four ambulances were also pressed into use At exactly 243 pm the right dome of the shrine fell The entire crowd got up to shout Jai Shree Rani Some of the women broke down tears streaming down their faces By then even the leaders had changed their tone Many of them shouted congratulations over the loud speakers By now old women and children were being urged to break down the shrine Come and do your bit Help to bring in Ram Rajya One of the kar sevaks ran up to presspersons and shouted What are you going to write today Tell the world that we brought in Hindu rashtra He said none of the kar sevaks had come for the symbolic kar seva We cannot come again again We have decided to finish it all in one go he added And it went on into the afternoon There were cheers but now all attention was focused on the main dome at the centre Sadhvi Ritbambhara and Ms Uma Bharati could be heard on the loud speakers urging kar sevaks to bring down the last dome It was all over at 450 pm and the kar sevaks went wild There was dancing on the disputed area But the demolition continued until there was no structure By then black smoke from burnt houses was billowing into the sky And the police came out on the streets and curfew was clamped The BJP accepted moral responsibility for the destruction of the disputed structure at Ayodhya Talking to newsmen in New Delhi the party vice-president Mr Sunder Singh Bhandari said it was the most unfortunate incident that it should not have occurred The VHP secretary-general Mr Ashok Singhal said demolition of the disputed structure at Ayodhya was not pre-planned and termed the kar sevaks action as surfacing of suppressed pent-up feeling The police fired at least three rounds in the Hathikhana and Fatehpura areas in Baroda following outbreak of large-scale violence late tonight No immediate reports of injury due to the firing was available However the police said that one person has been stabbed in Fatehpura area and has been admitted to Sayyaji General hospital where he is stated to be out of danger The
