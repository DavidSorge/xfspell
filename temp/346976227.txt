Facts Of Disturbances Cited With Moderation PREMIERS STATEMENT IN Continued Page 1 Column 7 refugees many of whom were killed There was also arson and loot Before Mr Nehru made this statement in the Rajya Sabha he had to answer a series of questions in the Lower House on the activities of the Pakistani Deputy High Commissioner and other Pakistani officials during their visits to Malda Thii was in response to Mr Kamath's motion calling attention to the charges of undiplomatic and prejudicial levelled against the Pakistani diplomats by the West Bengal Government ACTIVITIES Mr Nehru said that the conduct of these persons departed from diplomatic etiquette and the Union Government drew the attention of the Pakistani High Commissioner to what they had done Their visit to da had beeri anything but not the removal 6f tension As matter of fact there was slight recrudescence of trouble Mr Kamath asked the Piemiei whether there was any reason to suspect thai Pakistan and China were colluding to subject India to certain pressures in the coming months Mr Nehru said There are many suspicions But we do not go about shouting about them It is obvious that there is tension between India and China and there is tension between Pakistan and India How far they are influenced by these facts to come together and do something might embarrass us in a matter of conjecture WOMAN SLAPPED PTI adds Giving details of the Malda incidents Mr Nehru said that on March 9 there was some quarrel or altercation between Muslims and Santhal woman in village over the sale of plums The woman was slapped led to clash between Santhals and local Muslims in which several Santhals were injured The Santhals decided to carry out form of revenge burning of huts not killing but they were effectively prevented by the police and local authorities from doing so On March 22 in another village there was some trouble during the Holi celebrations between Santhals and Muslims Some Santhals attacked the village killed three Muslims using bows and arrows Three Muslim houses were set on fire and in one of them tragedy occurred when thatched roof collapsed and six more persons all Muslims were killed Mr Nehru said this was hardly 3 communal affair-it was more tribal affair Some Santhals had been irritated by what they thought was discourtesy to one of their women and they reacted to it As mailer of fact. many of the Muslims were given by the Hindus there when Santhals attacked them The local authorities took strong action and there the mailer ended Later West Bengal Minister went to Malda and spent considerable time here The Governor also visited the place MPs from this area had also been going round Much assistance was given to the families of those Muslims who had suffered from PAK DIPLOMATS VISIT Asthe Pakistani Deputy High Commissioner arid his First Secretary asked to be allowed to visit the district they were doing to go round several of the villages on April 5 6 and 7 They met large number of Muslims in various villages and went to mosque for their prayers meeting more people there They even addressed meetings here and there in the presence of West Bengal officers We have had some complaints that the Pakistan diplomats did not adhere to the pre-arranged itinerary and from place to place they met local residents privately the Premier said There was some little trouble on their trying to take photographs when they were told this would hot be allowed In any case they visited Malda because we wanted them to see and we had nothing to hide This ended the -first phase of what happened in Malda Unfortunately Mr Nehru went on the visit of the Pakistani Deputy High Commissioner had an unhealthy effect on the resident population and there was recrude science of trouble in some areas in Malda between April 16 and 20 do not wish to connect this recrudescence of trouble with his visit 1 am merely stating the facts chronologically and the belief of many people there Mr. Nehru said that in the first round of disturbances round about Malda nine or ten per cent of Hfg As against the Pakistani reports suggested that over 100 people had been killed 600 houses and shops looted and burnt and 1500 girls abducted and that hundreds of people had crossed over to Pakistan In the second series of events in Malda District he said four Muslims were killed and 36 Hindus and 28 Muslims were injured against these facts which were well known Pakistani newspapers given different accounts Mr Nehru added We officially informed Pakistan on April 27 in answer to their questions. exaggerated protest Note that there had been no incident in Malda after April 20 that dypr 70 people had been arrested law and order had been fully restored and there had been no abnormal migration from Malda across the border into Pakistan EXAGGERATED REPORTS Referring to the reports in Jie Pakistani press about the outbreak of violence in Murshidabad Mr Nehru said they were remarkable their exaggeration The Pakistan Times Lahore reported that 150 Muslims had been killed in Murshidabad and that large number of girls had been abducted The Dacca newspaper Pakistan Observer thereupon sent special correspondent to Murand his report was that in fact nothing had happened there Mr Nehru quoted from what the correspondent had written namely that there had been no clash or even minor incident in Murshidabad preceding during or after the Malda disHe also noted that the correspondent had pointed out that in Murshidabad the population was 80 per cent Muslim Therefore it was very unlikely Mr Nehru said that Hindus who were 20 per cent would attack Muslims apart from the fact that nothing had happened If there was trouble Hindus would be the greater sufferers The Pakistan Observer had however two or three days later reputed its own correspondent Whether it was done under pressure he did not know but the fact remains that there has been no incident in communal trouble i Murshidabad District whatsoever PAK INCIDENTS Turning to the events in Dacca and Rajshahi districts Mr Nehru said that the Indian High Commissioner went to Dacca for four days while some of the Mission officials went to Rajshahi It is very difficult to get accurate figures about what happened there In Dacca one can more or less get actual figures but in Rajshahi and round about districts. like Pabna Rangpur Khulna and Mymcnsingh it is very difficult The East Pakistani Government had sent considerable number of soldiers of East Pakistani Rifles there to control the situation Presumably. this would not have been necessary unless the situation was pretty bad We have reports that on April 26 and 28 there were several cases of slabbing in Dacca and about dozen people had been killed and several more injured Mr Nehru said Calcutta-bound train was said to have been halted on April 25 sorrier were outside Rajshahi station and attacked large number of people were said to have been Killed in this incident The worst reports so far received were from Dharsha village in Rajshahi District Here apparently large number of Hindu refugees had been collected and put under the protection of an armed guard On April 29 whatever the reason the armed guard was withdrawn This was followed by an attack on the refugees in which many of them were said to have been killed Other reports of serious trouble involving loot arson abduction and murder had come from1 Pabna Bograj Khulna Ranpur and Mymensingh districts Mr Nehru said These are the facts so far as we know them 1 have stated them with considerable moderation 1 do not wish this action and reaction taking place But the facts are unfortunate and bad enough and concern us The Prime Minister then referred to the exchange of Notes. with -Pakistan and said that while he had given exact figures about Malda it was difficult to get exact figures oil the East Pakistani happenings But it does appear that considerably more persons were killed in the train incident and in Dborsha village in Eajshali
