Cops lacked expertise to handle riots News analysis Rv BOMBAY December 18 LAST week riots in the city have exposed the problems faced by the police in tackling violent mobs and their own deficiencies The result is that four policemen have lost their lives hundreds of others have been injured and some have not reported to their posts since the riots began week ago.Throughout last week the policemen who faced the violent mobs appeared confused and lack1 ed the expertise to handle the riots Their canes broke guns got jammed they were hungry harassed and some were even singled out and hacked death Successive commissioners of police have admitted that the training they receive before joining the force is the only one in the career of most policemen and officers in the city handling riots is only part of this training They have also in their first interviews to the press on becoming commissioners insisted that law and order management and crime control are two separate functions and should be bifurcated with separate forces for each of these commissioners after being promoted as director generals of police and their subsequent retirement from the force have not even taken up the cause of such basic necessity as food for their men on duty during such troubled times Some policemen were at their posts for over two days during the trouble last week and lived on only vada pav tea At the police station level patrolling has been intensified only in the last three years after the represence in the city increased leading to numerous encounters This too is restricted however to groups of policemen standing at road junctions or moving in wireless vans instead of on foot The result is that for most police officers especially those from the Indian Police Service recently posted here the city is just maze of unknown streets The latest patrolling technique is to construct police which are just small sheds where couple of constables and sub-inspectors sit with telephone at hand One of the factors responsible for Door Dolice is in number in relation to the population of the city While the population keeps increasing by the day the strength of the force has remained at just over 30000 for the last five years This in effect means that there is just one policeman for 367 people in the city The state government is not interested in recruiting more men for the simple reason that policing does not fetch any money Amazingly police officers point out that security to politicians takes up large chunk of their duty time leaving them with no time for training and no men for patrolling The police are in favour of sophisticated arms and trains and better equipment But increased fire power cannot be an alternative to lack of training in handling riots In fact any weapon more sophisticated than the rifles muskets and revolvers the police presently have would be disastrous in riot where firing seems to be the only solution Instead what the police need is better coordination with their headquarters and faster sturdier lighter vehicles to increase the mobility of the force It is also interesting to note that during the riots this time nobody even thought of. using the fire brigades water hoses technique that has been tested the world over Unless the police chiefs put their heads together and plan programme to train their men to tackle the two completely different functions of handling law and order and crime and the state government changes its attitudes towards police welfare situations like the one in the city last week is likely to recur
