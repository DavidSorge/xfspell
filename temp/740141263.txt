Not Ayodhya But Anomie Need For An Equitable India By RAJDEEP SARDESAI ONE question that has troubled many people about the postAyodhya rioting is why Bombay the country's financial capital and ostensibly its most cosmopolitan city should also have been the worst by communal violence Unfortunately they fail to see that under the glitter of Nariman Point lurks the grime of Dharavi Their failure is no different to that of people who were surprised when riots broke out in Los Angeles Bombays sister city earlier this year There again the sparkle of Hollywood concealed the squalor south-central Los Angeles If the Bush Administration made the blunder of dismissing the Los Angeles riots as being law-and-order problem the Maharashtra government is also in danger of falling into similar trap If it chooses to consider the violence that has already taken more than 200 lives as an administrative problem or even direct fall-out of events in Ayodhya it would be committing grave act of omission While Ayodhya was undoubtedly the spark that ignited the fire the reasons for the intensity of the mob fury go beyond the templemosque issue Dormant Volcano The reasons why Bombay and indeed much of urban India has become dormant volcano must be traced to the larger social tensions afflicting these places. Large-scale rural-urban migration the mushrooming of slums rampant landgrabbing easy availability of arms have created social condition which the French sociologist Emili Durkheim had once described as anomie ie normlessness Unless there is sustained and collective effort aimed at tackling the root causes of this state of anomie we are condemned to being pushed into vicious circle of social conflict Unfortunately if the political class has failed us in the weeks leading up to the kar seva deadline by its pusillanimity it is now in danger of going to the other extreme and overreacting to events The result is that rationality has been at discount even as emotional hysteria has hijacked political dialogue None can really escape censure in this regard Senior parliamentarians have been guilty of engaging in verbal jousting even as their constituencies. are burning Some MLAs have tried to make political capital of the violence by repeatedly calling for bandhs and alleging that the police have targeted only one community Fascist leaders like Shiv Sena chief Mr Bal Thackeray have made the most blatantly provocative statements Worst of all even ordinary citizen have suddenly begun making virtue of their religious Amidst the cacophony the voice reason and moderation has almost lost Perhaps this impassioned if exag response was only to be expected given the enormity of the tragedy at Ayodhya on December 6 Yet it has also suited the interests of the political class to kcc the issue simmering at high emotional plane for it gives them the luxury of not having to make the han choices that are necessary to the countrys wounded social fabric For example the Congress and the left forces may believe that by ritualistic homilies to concepts like secularism and sana they will recover their lost sheen But such sermonising car only have limited impact in the present polarised atmosphere It is only therefore when the is taken out of the political and religious domain that the country secular edifice can be rebuilt Re building the mosque or having multi-religious complex or communal organisations are knee jerk reactions that cannot solve that larger entropy bedevilling or society At best these actions can only be seen as symbolic efforts under taken either out of sense of guilt or else sheer expediency At worst the will further consolidate the Hindi constituency by giving the impression of witch-hunt and the secular-pseudo-secular debate from which the BJP has much of its ideological vigour Little Use Indeed while such debate may have its relevance in middle-class drawing rooms and pontifical semites of little use in the street and slums of teeming metropolis like Bombay For that is where resides this vast underclass that is ai once both suspicious and susceptible to communal rhetoric It is this underclass that finding itself left with no stake in the system has little hesitation in participating in riots and acts of vandalism And it is this very same underclass for whom concepts like secularism and rule of law are today empty notions By contrast the emotional appeal made by the forces of fundamental attractive because it seeks to compensate for the identity crisis suffered by those marginalised from society The reality though is that the only religion truly appealing to the poor is bread The Marie Antoinettes among our priest-politicians have been shrewd enough to keep their flock together by promising them cake On the one hand the Muslim underclass has been imprisoned in their ghettos by feudal leadership that links survival to remaining faithful to the ulema On the other the Hindu underclass is in similar fix caught between the Scylla of neglect and the Charybdis of majoritarianism The so-called secular centrist leadership woos them with populist sloganeering only at election time The Hindutva bandwagon chooses to play with their emotions by indoctrinating them into believing that religio-national pride and organizational loyalty will radically transform their lives This is patent lie since Ram cannot bring role Organised Effort The post-Ayodhya phase now provides historic opportunity to move away from Muslim isolaand Hindu deception and reinvent India on the basis of equity But this would require an organised year-end effort at the grassroots and not effete tokenism from above Given the moral bankruptcy of our political order such bottom-up approach to challenging fundamentals have to be undertaken by an enlightened citizenry First it would require greater spread of social education Today nearly one in two persons in Bombay slum pockets has not gone to high school Secondly it would involve increasing the avenues for gainful employment It is most unlikely that person with job and secure future would turn to gangsterism or spend weekend of mayhem in Ayodhya Thirdly would demand responsive administration at the local level Indeed one of the most disturbing aspects of the recent rioting has been the city towards authority The local police is seen as unjust and communalised even as the municipal officials are viewed as inert and corrupt Finally the bottom-up approach needs to encourage the channels of communication among communities An increasingly cynical populace may see this to be Utopian agenda However ray of hope is provided by Bhiwandi the industrial township near Bombay In the past Bhiwandi has been communal hotspot and the scene of violent riots in 1970 1974 and 1984 Yet this time Bhiwandi has been almost totally tension-free The reasons for the transformation can be traced to the mohalla committees that bring people from different faiths. together every fortnight sustained social awareness campaign and an emphasis on greater economic interdependence If Bhiwandi can do it why cant the country
