The killing fields The current communal violence in Ahmedabad has shattered several myths reports AshrafSayed THE latest outbreak of communal violence in Ahmedabad has shattered many myths That chief minister Chimanbhai Patel is not only a shrewd politician but also an able administrator that the police is protector of the people and their properties that the deployment of the army can bring the situation under control and last but not least that religious frenzy can prevail only for few hours and not for weeks together. First the chief minister failed to gauge the intensity of violence its changing character and get his orders strictly implemented by the top brass of the police The police commissioner not only erred in his judgement but even ignored orders from his political bosses. further messing up the situation In many instances the police turned Nelson's eye to the acts of hooligans and in some cases even encouraged and provided protection to arsonists and hooligans In the second phase of the communal violence the problem was more collapse of the police force rather than the lack of political will to act The deployment of the army was first delayed for days Than the entire police hierarchy opposed tooth and nail the governments move to hand over worst hit areas like Odhav Bapunagar Gomtipur Vatva and Amraiwadi in the eastern belt of the city to the army on the ground that this would hurt its morale The army's presence has so far remained symbolic while corrupt and communal police force has failed both the people and the politicians The result is there for everyone to see and repent Many heads may roll in the coming days but that cannot be solace for the people who have suffered immensely Thousands of people will nurse bitter memories for years to come. of the loss of their near and dear ones the systematic destruction of their homes and shops business centres and industrial units and of the inhuman treatment given to women apart from shattering the social fabric great divide has been created between the two main communities which will be difficult to bridge The second bout of communal violence in the city which broke out on January 8 and still continues unabated has so far taken toll of 151 lives and left hundreds of others with multiple injuries has many different characteristics The atmosphere was tense for 48 hours previously with the Bharatiya Janata Party and RSS and VHP volunteers celebrating the demolition of the Babri Masjid on January 6 by lighting lamps and bursting fire crackers The next day BJP actors to the streets to protest against the passage of the bill in the state assembly postponing elections to the four municipal corporations of Ahmedabad Baroda Rajkot and Surat and all other elections to district taluka panchayatsand municiin the state till October 3 1 By preventing the BJP from adopting any constitutional methods to checkmate his government the chief minister forced it to take to the streets. But that was not grave enough provocation for the communal violence.The next morning the battle was mainly between the people and the police in the Raipur Khadia Manek Chowk and Gandhi Road localities which are dominated by the majority community But the clashes between the police and the people suddenly took communal turns during Friday prayers on January 8 when 200-strong mob attempted to destroy Two places of worship belonging to the minority community in majority-community areas This ignited large-scale communal violence As many as 119 stabbing incidents took place within just two hours throwing all police arrangements haywire and creating panic on an unprecedented scale The death roll on that single day was officially put at 38 in stabbing and police firing the police immediately clamped curfew in the entire walled city and also summoned the Border Security Force and the army to step up patrolling in the affected areas But soon retaliation came from mobs suspected to belong the BJP and the RSS which burnt factories industrial units godowns houses huts and shops on large scale in the industrial-cumber belt of Odhav Vatva Bapunagar Gomtipur and Amraiwadi areas in the eastern periphery of the city for the past week 75 per cent of the city's three million people are reeling under curfew while sporadic riots continue to rock the city The police is estimated to have fired more than 5500 rounds since December 6 to disperse rampaging mobs in different parts of the state including Surat Ahmedabad Broach Baroda Mehsana Godhra Sidhpur Palanpur and Anand The states. death toll has mounted to 367 in just 36 days while Ahmedabad toll is 148 The loss to private and public properties trade and business state government and various civic bodies as well to wageearners is roughly estimated at Rs 9600 crore reshuffle of police officers in Ahmedabad and Surat the appointment of one-man commission headed by retired high court judge Mr Justice IC Bhatt and announcement of package deal for the mercantile community and industrialists to help them revive their units may not go long away because such measures are routinely announced after devastating tragedies the transfers of police officers are seen as an eye-wash to shift the people's attention from the failure of politicians and to make scapegoats of the police It is well-known that the state government has hardly acted on the voluminous report of the ready commission appointed after the September riots in 1969 when nearly 2500 people were killed More than 212 people lost their lives public and private property worth Rs 2415 crores was destroyed The then chief minister Madhavsinh Solanki had to bow out of office and Gujarat took couple of years to come out of the trauma of the aftermath of the agitation That Ahmedabad is one of the most communally sensitive cities in the country has now become truism The communal carnage on October 30 in the wake of the Ayodhya yatra by LK Advani claimed 242 lives on single day while 575 others nursed wounds for weeks and months together. Once again the city is churning in the communal cauldron Intervention by saner political and social forces from within and outside the state would help defuse the explosive situation but such moral intervention appears to be sadly missing Why does Ahmedabad city with 13 per cent Muslim population? keep burning The answer lies in socio-economic factors abetted by religiosity bordering on fundamentalism and political exigencies But if you put the question to leaders of political parties Bharatiya Janata Party will blame it on the Patel ministry and the chief minister will certainly raise an accusing finger at the sangh private both must share the blame
