cease to make news as matter of rule once they are out of it Mr Ibrahim who had to leave the ministry headed by Mr Gundu Rao in Karnataka at the end of series of scandals that rocked the legislature in the early 80s is an exception to this rule Though he has remained outside the pale of high-level political activity in the Congress since 1983 and maintained low profile of local police have suspected his hand in every incident in which Muslims became either restive or violent The most recent example of this is the rioting that broke out in the predominantly Muslim areas of Bangalore following the publication of a short story that was considered offensive by Muslims The Shivajinagar police picked him up on December 8 for allegedly provocative speech and Muslims to indulge in violence the previous evening The controversial former minister however stoutly denied this at press conference and maintains that he had while addressing crowd in front of the Deccan Herald office. only appealed to the crowd to disperse and remain peaceful INCITING SPEECH According to the first report filed by the police in the metropolitan magistrates court soon his inciting speech was made by Mr Ibrahim not in front of the Deccan Herald office but near the Russel Market Muslim area short distance away ThcFIR said Mr Ibrahim went there one evening at 515 pm with two of his brothers Mr Khade and Mr Sadiq and couple of followers who gathered crowd for this former minister to address He told this crowd that the article published ii Deccan Herald was with an intention to insult Prophet Mohammed and to hurt the feelings of Muslims He instigated the crowd to attract the attention of all Muslims He said that as Muslims they keep quiet and they should attack the Deccan Herald press should dose down shops and damage public transport vehicles the FIR said It was after this that the crowd became restive forced shops to dose stoned vehicles and started moving towards the Deccan Herald office This is not the first instance in which Mr Ibrahim was involved in an issue concerning the minority community He and his party colleague Miss Pramila were said to be principally. responsible for the riots that took place in Chamarajpet over the issue of the -Idah grounds Mr Ibrahim and Miss Pramila took up rival positions on behalf of Muslims and Hindus Only year or so later both of them went over to the Congress Two years ago when Muslim youth said to be confirmed criminals died in the Shivajinagar police lock-up Muslims in that area took to violence and the police at that time accused Mr Ibrahim of fomenting trouble ROWDY BROTHERS Mr Ibrahim very colourful politicians go in Karnataka has had very chequered career Controversial as he is it is the doings of his brothers known to the police as notorious rowdies that caused him great deal of trouble As young of the Congress he came into prominence in the early 70s largely because of the powerful speeches sometimes rhetorical that he delivered at public meetings of his party Before that his role in politics particularly during his days in Bhadravati in Shimoga district was not significant In fact Mr. Ibrahim was the star speaker for the Congress Known not to pull his punches he could lace his speeches with appropriate stories and quotations from mythology and the puranas to drive home points. command over Kannada and his vast knowledge of Hindu mythology won him applause It was said in those days that he used to hurl unprintable abuse at the late Mrs Indira Gandhi in public meetings Like most opposition activists Mr Ibrahim was also detained during the emergency He contested on behalf of the Janata and lost from Dharwar south in the Lok Sabha election in 1977 and won the Shivajinagar. assembly seat for the Janata in 1978 and defected to the Congress headed by Mrs Gandhi in 1979 after Mr Devraj Urs parted company with her When Mr Gundu Rao formed his government in 1980 Mr Ibrahim was made minister and held portfolios such as small industries labour and food and civil supplies That is when he got involved in one controversy after another The first was when he made public speech in Uavanagere claiming that the Saudi Arabian government had presented him with Rolex watch with the falcon insignia which allowed him entry at will to Saudi Arabia The issue cropped up in the legislature causing great deal of embarrassment to the government Thereafter as the minister for civil supplies he allegedly helped flour mills in the allocation of wheat after the Union government had imposed restrictions CBI inquiry into this however cleared him of the charge As the minister for small industries Mr Ibrahim also held under his charge the state-owned Handicraft Emfrom where the next scandal broke The emporium had reportedly tried to include in packages meant for Saudi Arabia an antique sword This it was alleged was done at the instance of Mr Ibrahim even while the opposition was hurling charges against him within and outside the legislature the activities of his two brothers Mr Rehman and Mr Khader in Bhadravati led to serious trouble in that industrial town One of them Mr Rehman was said to have been responsible for murdering RSS activists. He himself was later murdered MOLESTATION BID Some time later Mr Khader allegedly tried to molest middle-aged woman in nearby village when she tried to stop him from making overtures to her daughter Not that she was forcibly brought to Bangalore and allegedly confined in Mr Ibrahim's house by official residence as minister to threaten her against going to the police However when she went back to Bhadravati she promptly lodged complaint in the magistrates court This scandal proved too embarrassing even for Mr Gundu Rao who asked Mr Ibrahim to resign That was in August 1981 In the election to the legislative assembly in 1983 Mr Ibrahim contested again from Shivajinagar this time on Congress ticket Me lost to Mr Raghupathy With the decline in the fortunes of Mr Gundu Rao in the Congress Mr Ibrahim also took back seat When Mr Gundu Rao was expelled from the Congress in July this year Mr Ibrahim was also expected to join him He stayed back in the Congress Mr Ibrahim complains that the local police are unnecessarily dragging his name into the recent incidents although he had nothing to do with what happened in Bangalore will quit politics if the police can prove made provocative speech he contends The Angel education complex at Veraa
