Normalcy coming too slowly to Sambhal By SUBHASH KIRPEKAR DE11DE AND SEN SAMBHAL April 7 II is unlikely this old kasbah will ever be the same again reputation of peace and harmony zealously guarded by its citizens over the centuries have been tarnished The Sambhal that had carefully tided over the tortures of partition unscathed and quietly passed into obscurity has now shot into notoriety What is disturbing is that the authorities do not seem to appreciate and understand fully the problems of restoring normalcy to this riot-rocked town If show of force and the barrel of the gun could wipe out terror fill empty stomachs and reestablish goodwill and public confidence Sambhal would be happy by now Unfortunately one discerns certain official callousness towards the entire population of Sambhal which is made to suffer mincer and hardship for the aberrant behaviour of small trouble-makers now in jail exactly seven days after the rioting took place and curfew was imposed there are no official arrangements to distribute essential items like tea milk and kerosene oil This team of reporters saw mad scramble for by men women and children chasing trucks sent by relief organisation from Moradabad 30 km away It carried atta gur potato and milk As it drove slowly down narrow road in congested locality where curfew was relaxed for a couple of hours people clambered up its sides and hung on even as groups of women stood on rooftops with outstretched hands in bid to secure something to eat In other areas where the curfew is not relaxed all doors and windows of residential buildings are shut tight despite the stifling heat The closed metal shutters of shop restaurants and chemists gleam in the sun Except for the steel-helmeted policemen patrolling the streets or lazing in the shade not -a soul stirs in this ghost town INADEQUATE PLANNING There is no sign that the authorities are planning adequately to deal with the situation which will arise when the curfew is lifted What will happen to the shops that have been burnt Who will pay compensation If no compensation is paid and the tenant-shopkeeper decides to invest in raising the structure and will he not choose to ignore the owner Again should the owner decide to construct afresh will he not demand new and higher rent Large-scale litigation can naturally be expected It is inevitable owners and tenants will belong to both the communities curious fact here is that both the communities consider themselves to be the minority community One of the surest means of estanormalcy speedily is to have group of respectable citizens from peace committee which will move from house to house Local politicians should scrupulously be kept out of any such committee as their proto mislead the police magistracy and even the press is enormous One tends to think that these persons armed with curfew passes are spreading falsehoods and hatred right under the nose of the local administration From the view of restoration of public confidence in the administration it would be fair to quickly effect change of officials right down the line as there appears to be tremendous resentment against the existing group From the long-term viewpoint Sambhal immediately needs bigger police force better communications and some fire-fighting units On the day of the riot these tenders had to be called in from Moradabad Rampur and Bareilly The tragedy has apparently shaken up the administration into some kind of activity. It is now realised that the recommendations of the police commissions in 1960-61 and 1970 should have been implemented These pertained to the setting up of second police station and increasing the police force For population of 100,000 and in district that was from the days of the British labelled as communally sensitive Sambhal had sanctioned police strength of only one inspector five sub-inspectors 12 head constables and 135 constables. Since the authorities seldom adhere to the sanctioned strength the actual number was much lower And even from this number there were the usual policemen away on leave sick office duties and such other work Added to this was the fact that the two police outposts did not have telephones TOO MANY FIREARMSWhat makes the situation worse the mushroom growth of firearms Of the 21000 licensed firearms is the whole of Moradabad district the Sambhal tehsil has 600 In Chandausi there are more arms outside the than inside Intel licence officers volunteer the information that the number of un-licenced firearms vastly exceeds this figure Several illegal firearm factories found not only in Moradabad district but also in the nearby districts of Rampur and Bulandshahr Senior officials say that it is difficult to reject applications seeking licences to possess firearms Political interference at all levels based mainly on communal considerations is rampant It is no wonder that the licence issuing officer sometimes finds himself consciously or maintaining the principle of parity common reason given by applicants for gun licenses is that there are too many dacoits and criminals in the area Alt is different matter that these firearms are seldom used But what vitiates the atmosphere is the presence of so many guns and rifles and constant possibility of some trigger-happy people starting something It is probably for this reason that the administration is contemplating to review the entire firearms situation It may even cancel licences if need be If the administration indeed to treat Moradabad district as communally sensitive area it would have speedily settled many of the minor irritants that are exploited to the hilt by communal-minded politicians But the situation is quite the reverse The denial of permission by the local authorities to take out the Bara Wafat procession for the last decade or so is another irritant Like on other occasions Holi Moharrum Divali when the administration deploys some 70P-odd PAC men as precautionary step it can probably organise safety mechanism for this also The PAC force positioned this time for Holi was withdrawn after the festival passed off peacefully. In the aftermath of the March 29 riot the police have registered 117 first information reports suspended 73 arms licences asked another 40 to surrender their arms and arrested 156 persons including Mr Manzar Shafi who is now roundly abused by members of both communities and the authorities of the 16 killed in the violence the corpses of 10 have not been identified as they are charred beyond recognition Mr Tripathi superintendent of police CID crime branch has come from Lucknow for investigation Every riot has its share of rumours It was no different in Sambhal World went round that the number of casualties was several times more than the officially quoted figure 16g People believed it The authorities had thoughtfully arranged fleet of buses to take people out of Sambhal It emerged that some 1400 outsiders who had come for shopping in the weekly hat bazaar availed the transport provided Most of those feared missing returned to waiting times in town The tension eased The situation was bad but not as bad as was made out by trouble-makers Meanwhile it needs to be pointed out that the Holi titles referred to in the earlier report were not conferred on the two girls alone whole lot of boys and girls from both communities were the recipients Moreover the titles had been conferred by boys and girls of both communities Mr Lai Singh Verma inspector general of police sought to dispel the impression that the mob could not have indulged in arson near the without police connivance The police force was engaged in meeting trouble at three other places simultaneously thus drawing the effect tive force of 50 away from the According to Mr Verma the police force at Sambhal has always been understaffed and one lesson drawn was the need for another thana in the main sensitive area of Nakasa. One handicap felt by fire-fighting personnel was the total lack of water hydrants They were forced to draw water from big ponds on the outskirts of the townTni3 experience has highlighted the need for permanent fire for Sambha
