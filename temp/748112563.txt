Violence In The Air Mercifully clashed on Monday at Paradip between the dock workers and the police in which at least five persons were killed had nothing to do with the nation-wide of port labour It was occasioned by relatively petty quarrel between posse of the Orissa armed police posted to keep guard near the workers colony and the residents The policemen were first stoned at their post. when they went into the colony to apprehend the culprits they were attacked with knives iron rods and country bombs They opened fire in self-defence Within few minutes four policemen and worker lay dead and as many as thirty others were injured quite few seriously for no-good reasons. But this was only one of the several instances of mindless violence that erupted during bloody week in different parts of the country Indeed the fact that so many revellers went berserk and killed or assaulted innocents during the Holi festivities in Delhi on March 17 is if anything even more bizarre factory worker who declined to participate in the celebrations was dragged out of his house in Sarai Rohilla and stabbed to death with all things pair of musical tongs Another person was fatally knifed just because he refused to lend drum to his assailants All in fill with three persons killed and many more injured it was perhaps the most tragic Holi in the capital since independence That was not all The very next day in Calcutta youni deputy commissioner of police Mr Vinod Kumar and his bodyguard Mr Muqtar Ahmed Khan were trapped hacked to death and thrown into gutter in one of the worst. orgies of its kind in that benighted city Their only fault was that while trying to quell clash between two communities they had walked into the den of smugglers The attempts made in the country to explain the increasing level of violence in society have focused so far on economic stress of politics sharpening of cable communal and regional conflicts and erosion of morals 1 Torts have been made therefore to deal with each one of these factors piecemeal Rehabilitation schemes are under way for dacoits in the Chambal valley school curricula are sought to be revamped organizations to promote national integration is active and the police forces are being strengthened everywhere But few seem to realise that much of the violence that is rife in society today springs from deep-seated feeling of insecurity The penalties for breaking the law are as uncertain as the rewards for abiding by it The future of groups as well as individuals has become huge question marks In consequence the prevailing social turmoil is indivisible and the distinction between personal crimes gangsterism and brutal terrorism of politically motivated groups has been blurred The kind of violence that erupted in recent days in Delhi Orissa West Bengal and elsewhere cannot be curbed unless this fact is recognised and the problem tackled accordingly.
