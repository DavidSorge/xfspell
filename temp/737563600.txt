munal hatred It all began with shocking crime and no one in his senses would anything but the gravest view of the criminal assault on the young girl who subsequently took her own life But the reaction this tragic incident has been frighteningly senseless There is little doubt that if the alleged culprits had belonged to the same community as the victims the incident would have been just another case for the police and they would have dealt with it in the normal way But the alleged culprits and the victim belonged to different communities and the stage was set for yet another orgy of communal violence The grisly drama of the past five days has already claimed 14 lives and many houses have been burnt down Communal tension is said to have spread from Jabalpur to other cities and towns Madhya Pradesh -to Bhopal and to Damoh to Katni and to Sehoraand one can only hope that sanity will be restored before the madness takes heavier toll of innocent lives The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and other State leaders have done well to go to Jabalpur They should meet civic leaders and urge them to form harmony committees in the various municipal wards And it would be a good thing if The opposition parties in the State joined hands with the Congress in helping to restore normalcy in the affected areas overcoming the tradition to make political capital out of the city's terrible pl Jabalpur is grim reminder that the communal poison has yet to be flushed out of the nations system It would be foolish to believe that this can be done easily The poison has been in the system for too long to permit such belief The real trouble is that too many people among them the country's leaders pretend that all is well on the communal front and that incidents such as those in Jabalpur now or in Ferozepur last September or in Sitaand Bhopal two years ago are an occasional throwback to the bad old days which belong to the dead past But the absence of constant communal violence should not be mistaken for communal harmony The past is still very much with us And it will remain with us posing latent threats to national unity so long as we pretend that the relations between the two major communities do not need to be improved consciously It is neto make deliberate effort to promote genuine harmony between the communities And this is a task to which all political parties should address themselves in the national interest Joy caning in the military to Aid the police and clamping curfew on the city the authorities have succeeded in imposing calm on Jabalpur But the calm is deceptive The citizens are tense and thousands of them are consumed with JABALPUR
