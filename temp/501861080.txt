Havoc That to During Meerut Riot ByN country is shocked by Afeerut riots on account of their undue prolongation In terms of casualties the country has witnessed much worse riots during recent years Both the Union home minister and the UN chief minister have promised detailed enquiry and therefore comment on the issues jn dispute should be withheld but one important -aspect of the distressing events merits immediate attention It is the havoc played at Meerut by rumours The city is only 42 miles from Delhi and with the help of the Centres help the riots could have been controlled much earlier of all kinds of vicious rumours were not afloat Rumour is one of the few powerful weapons whose mechanism is very difficult to detect It seems as if it springs from nowhere and spreads. everywhere It reaches the top bosses of internal security forces and they themselves become confused about how to deal with it To contradict rumour by modern means of communication like radio press. and television is not difficult But what is the point of such contradiction when large section of the public is inclined to believe precisely the opposite of what the administration says Fantastic. Nonsense During riot people seem prepared to believe even the most fantastic nonsense or falsehood The scare that the city's water supply had been poisoned spread so fast in Meerut one evening that even the educated abstained from drinking the wafer Some went to the extent of throwing away their cooked meals When deputy commandant of the BSF Mr Ajit Malik shot himself rumour-mongers promptly. changed his religion and gave out his name as Abdul Sattar Malik It was alleged that he had been murdered Some rumours have become so trite that they crop up in every riot or fracas The other community is fearing itself is typical example By its own dynamics this rumour sometimes turns into reality because each community tries to outdo the other in arming itself as measure of self-defence Each bomb explosion in Meerut and each recovery of firearms from misbecame the basis for fresh rumours ignoring the fact that bad characters belonging to both communities always have stock of handy. This has been the case for well over decade But no one has been able to reduce leave alone to recover these lethal hoards Merchants of communal hatred have now acquired expertise and sophistication So things are not exactly what they appear on the surface Meerut Migarh Moradabad Ranchi and many other cities have developed cadres trained in the art of stabbing The agencies have to make list of them and get them detained before they can do any mischief Bach isolated stabbing done for the sim-i pie objective of killing one person of the opposite community is lished jas -It is talked about so that criminal act becomes the Bourgeois incitement to start chair of similar acts Everyone who Tumour cannot possibly be arrested For mp people give of circulation to without evil intent But if the originators of rumour can be apthey must be dealt with mercilessly Even if enough evidence to get them convicted cannot be found they ought to be dealt with under the law on preventive detention. Fighting Rumours Rumours cannot be fought by baton para-military forces This job can be done only by the agencies In the states at least these agencies have long been in the doldrums In several states sub-insane inspectors will even refuse promotion to avoid being posted to the intelligence branch In Bombay police vacancies in the special branch are difficult to fill In UP and elsewhere one on the farecommendations of political big wigs is to prevent the transfer of -police officers even on promotion to the intelligence branch However even 0e most sophisticated intelligence agency cannot 4 the origin of all rumoursThe ultimate remedy against rumours is the credibility of the senior officers in district Their contradiction will carry weight only if people have faith in their past. impartiality and truthfulness Machiavelli 1469-1527 said that the ruler must always speak the truth so that his occasional lies could be believed This sage advice is very valid as far as the administration hag-ridden by the politicians is concerned The problem of bridging the little gap was acute even earlier Meerut has vastly aggravated it
