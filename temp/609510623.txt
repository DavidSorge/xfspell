However the district had  administration and several politicians insist that the riots were natural culmination of the tension building up here over Babri Masjid-Ram Janam Bhoomi controversy They fail to explain as to why communal peace was disturbed four-and-a-half months after the episode It could be pointed out that the city was trouble-free during the traumatic month of February when riots had broken out in half dozen major cities of the state over the unlocking of the Bhoomi gates The protagonists of the communal theory claimed that the riot was planned here after such long gap in order to defame the government as Allahabad happened to be VIP constituency The district magistrate Mr Anil Kumar when questioned chose to be non-committal He would rather ignore the long-term effects of communal polarisation on false issues that haul in the culprits and risk immediate displeasure of politicians of all hues two-day tour of the riot-affected areas discredits the propaganda that the city is in grip of communal turmoil Complete absence of communal acrimony even in those areas where the rioting has been the worst knocks the bottom out of the argument that the strife has communal genesis Residents of Attala Shahganj AtKhuldabad and Nakas Kona from where the violence started speak of the horrors of the night of June 14 and IS which saw bomb blasts and indiscriminate firing from roof. tops They even claim that the scene appeared to be akin to civil war But interestingly the death roll injury list and the loss of property has been minimal Moreover even when the communalists were armed with weapons including telescopic rifles they did not perpetuate any spectacle The reason for this is no efficient policing for the police acted only when it was all over Obviously the perpetrators of the riots only wanted to create scare This is further borne out by the fact that bomb blasts took place simultaneously in five localities of the city or June 15 About 50 country-made bombs were lobbed All of them were designed in such way that the exploded with very loud noise bu with little damage NO ECONOMIC BLOWS Another aspect which goes to the communal theory is the complete absence of loot even when the rioting was at its zenith This is perhaps the only riot of its kind in which the two communities did no deal economic blows to each other Allahabad witnessed very few case of stabbings and mob arson Except for an attack on Harijan basti near Kareli housing scheme and burning down oi about half dozen shops and roadside stalls there has been no other incident However this is not to mean that the rioting was of casual variety Exile shots use of countrymade pistols and revolvers and throwing of brickbats and bottles created week-long terror in the lanes and bylanes of the city Miscreants also fired flares in the darkness of the night to cause panic They were taken by the people to mean signals being sent Out from one locality to another for fomenting fresh trouble Communal slogans were also raised but fortunately they failed to have the necessary impact They did succeed in prolonging the curfew and getting political mileage.
