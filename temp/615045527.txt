Ashta rioting still puzzles officials By PANCHAL The Times of India News Service ASHTA MP Bhopalnation 1 highway runs right through this tehsil town where roadside cafes were so famous that the tourists used to halt for while Now it is no longer so All those cafes and other shops went up in flames in the communal flare-up on Rangpanchami day Charred bodies of trucks blackened remains of the cafes and the acrid smell of burnt goods filled the air when this reported visited the place three days after the rioting on March 26 What happened in Bhopal on the last day of the Holi festival My childs prank after look at the damage in Ashta Twenty-six shops 22 houses 22 huts three trucks one matador van eight handcarts and three sheds were set on fire within just 45 minutes The first estimate of the damage put at Rs 25 lakhs by the district collector Mr Khusiram appears quite conservative How did it all happen Again it is familiar pattern Like in Bhopal the authorities were taken for ride We were taken by surprise admits the collector who says that it was shocking to see such large-scale destruction in taluka town in such short time It appears to be well-planned affair says senior police officer He regretted the total failure of intelligence Some stones were hurled at the Rangpanchami procession around 330 pm and as if on some remote signal shops and houses at four. places in the town were set on fire simultaneously This could not be treated as spontaneous reaction We did not get any intelligence report on that score said the collector ruefully But warning signals were there The Hindus constitute marginal majority in the population of 25000 in the town which had witnessed similar clashes on the same day three years ago Also the district town Sehore is known as sensitive spot day prior to Rangpanchami someone threw colour on mosques door The police tried to get it painted but some Muslims intervened and said photographs must be taken to police complaint registered before painting meeting of the 60-member peace committee was called on the morning of Rifgpanchami Everybody Hindu as well as Muslim leaders assured us that nothing would happen if the procession was led by Mr Fulchan Rathod an elder citizen Mr Rathod was among the first few who were hit on the head when the 2000-strong procession neared the Shahajaham mosque Three-fourths of the people had already passed when stones were hurled The collector found the situation getting out of control He promulgated prohibitory orders under section 144 ordered firing of tear-gas shells then lathi-charge and finally imposed curfew When the people refused to disperse 1 rounds were fired injuring four persons The town will take quite long time before it returns to normal conditions significant feature of the rioting was that the shops cafes and trucks were burnt selectively The shops were looted before being set on fire It was not an offshoot of mere religious frenzy as it is made out by some leaders and officials It must be said to the credit of the people that both in Bhopal and Ashta they by and largely refused to be taken in by those bent upon creating trouble Despite various incidents of arson there was no single case of stabbing or assault on any citizen The chief minister Mr Motilal Vora and the leader of the opposition Mr Kailash Joshi are not exaggerating when they say that communal harmony is tradition among the people of the state After the withdrawal of curfew people have begun moving about freely and without any fear Hindu and Muslim neighbors meet and talk frankly about what happened to their town They have had lots to say
