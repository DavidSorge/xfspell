Aligarh riots-II Aligarh -H sad lack of proper perspective By and SEN ALIGARH October 19 THIS is by no means the first communal riot in Aligarh Noi1 is there any reason to believe that it would be the last According to the district police unofficials Aligarh Minder-box which can be set till the smallest spark The Superintendent of police Mr If two cycledriven by members of different communities collide riot may We are kept on tenterhooks ill the time Aligarh has had long history of riots especially since 1930 and yet strangely enough the adcontinues to view each in isolation It seems to feel Jiatall that is required to do is to implement 3ts riot-control scheme whenever trouble erupts In the case of the October 5 riots the administration does not care to look beyond the provocative. funeral procession of Bhura According to the district magistrate Mr Bagla arrested even half the population of the city would not have necessarily prevented riot after the procession had been allowed to be taken out The administration viewing the riot as simple law and order problem has also come to the conclusion that wrestlers and are sources of disharmony It has taken steps to shut down the temporarily and has arrested part-time wrestlers regarded as suspicious characters The admin has also cancelled all the 3700 arms licences but has taken no real steps to either seize these arms or to seal the shops selling ammunition Officials have apparently no idea of the precise number of illicit firearms in troubled Aligarh although great many are known to have been brought in from Rampur and Moral theory that Bhura's death alone has caused an extremely serious riot is open to doubt For Habib one of the three alleged killers of Bhura is known to have had petty grudge of long standing against him In fact in the beginning the officials themselves tended to view Bhuras stabbing as crimeThe district administration on its own admission has been walking political tightrope for quiet some time It-Bas been under constant piesContinued on Page 4 Column 6 Hovels of poor ruined in riots Continued from Page 1 Column 3 sure from the two major political parties in Janata and Congress Several citizens who claim to belong to neither party complain that the administration has constantly caved in to political pressure sometimes exerted from Lucknow the state capital by remote control Officials admit that they have faced veritable barrage of requests from the Janata and Congress leaders to release some part-time wrestlers who are also part-time party workers It is only by adroitly. playing off one party against the other that the administration has been able to extricate itself from an extremely difficult situation PAC FLAYED Even so the impartiality of the administration has been questioned Some members of the Aligarh Muslim University staff allege that the lower echelons of the administration have been thoroughly infiltrated by the RSS The conduct of one circle officer of the police appears to lend credence to this belief He had refused to obey orders of -senior officer to control the mob before it had reached the crucial Chauraha Abdul Karim Again it was he who subsequently appointed himself press censor and impounded copies of this newspaper Inexplicably no action has yet been taken against him Some others have gone to the extent of alleging that the SSP Mr Prasad is secret sympathiser of the RSS They claim he had attended meeting of the RSS on September 15 where he had offered Guru dakshina and saluted the RSS flag The district magistrate has however. denied all this Mr Javid Habib president of the AMU Students Union has alleged that the conduct of the PAC has been reprehensible He is not alone in complaining that instead of firing on the rioting mob the PAC often fired on the victims By contrast there is general praise for the CRP CENTRAL FIGURE There seems to be near unanimity on the view that the riot has not been communal in nature This has however not prevented various sections from political academic and administrative from charging one another with religious central figure to feature in almost all Mr Nayman the Aligarh unit of the Janato party who makes no bones about his RSS affiliations Football accounts Mr Navman has been named in as many as eight FIRs filed day of the riot Tfte officials regard him as big nuisance in the ar as he has tendency to throw his weight around They also say that his activities are sullying of the RSS and the Janata party JHis alleged range from interceding on behalf of the arrested part-time. wrestlers to breaking the curfew after refusing to apply for curfew pass Mr Navman had in fact been arrested outside his house following an altercation with PAC men during hours He cites this as proof that the administration is not biased in favour of either him or his party QUICK RELEASE Navmans quick release after bis has been very strongly criticized But he says no special favour was shown to hi he was let off Nineteen other curbeen released at the same But this does not explain either the with which he was taken toh9Use on Sunday or the of frig coincidence after the UP hief -Mr Ram Yadav had visited the riotstricken town On his Mr Navman sees the hand of the Congress behind the riot The Janata party he says would benefit most from united population while the Congress would reap maximum dividends by preying on factionalism Yet he too insists that the riot was essentially non-cbmMore serious incidents than the fracas involving Bhura had taken place he says just before and immediately after the Aligarh riot he gives gory details of these provocative incidents said to have occurred in places not far from the town and yet according to him at both places the situation remained under control whereas in Aligarh it was allowed to get out of hand His explanation for this is that the Congress activists moved in to fan the flames of hatred According to Mr Navman Bhura himself was Congress sympathiser Mr Navman projects himself as stout defender of the minorities and claims that this has earned him the wrath of some of his supporters At the same time he attempts to hide his displeasure over the predominance of Muslims af AMU REVOLT BREWING His critics have indeed alleged that he once threatened to repeat Marathwada at Aligarh This he denies emBut he adds frankly that while he does not mind the affairs of the university being managed by Muslims he would fight for the right of Hindus to study there There are indications of revolt brewing in the Janata ranks against the leadership of Mr Navman local paper has reported that 18 of the 28 members of the city Janata and hoc committee have signed memorandum demanding his sign from the party Dr Pannalal an old rival of Mr Navman and leader of the erstwhile Congress is spearheading the campaign The signatories have objected to the violation of the curfew by Mr Navman and this has encouraged members of the AMUStudents Union to ask rhetorically Vlf Mr Raj Narain could be asked to quit the Union cabinet for violating section 144 at Simla why is Mr Navman so far escaping similar action for the grave charge of breaking curfew regulations and obstructing public servants on duty But Mr Navman dismisses the charge as minor one The charge is likely to be discussed by the ad hoc committee soon PLANNING Mr Khurshid Alam Khan Congress MP who had visited AH recently says The entire unfortunate incident can be attributed to Mr Navmans planning He appears to be all-powerful in the district Members of the local unit of the Congress hint darkly at the possibility of Mr Nivman having received patronage from higher quarters Mr Shivhari Shtngal president of the local bar and president of the city unit of the erstwhile Jana Sangh is also accused of -complicity in -the riot According to local Congress leaders large RSS workers had descended town from other parts of UP just -before the riots Mr Khurshid Alam Khan goes so far as to say that the onus for all communal riots in Aligarh since 1947 falls on the RSS which he had has its divisional headquarters in the town local Congress leader however thinks that the impetus behind all the riots in Ajgarh since 1930 has from section of the city's business community He adds that the instigators have adopted different political garbs at different times CAMPUS DISCONTENT For instance according to this Congress leader his own undivided party used to be responsible for communal riots soon after independence The hitherto undisturbed AMU campus is simmering with discontent over the postponedexaminations badly disrupted careers and the possible threat to life -According to Dr Hashim Kidwai president of the AMU Staff Association there is widespread anger among the students at the lack of protection to the minorities in such situations The students have been discussing the alternatives between fighting back and creating peaceful atmosphere They have so far opted for the latter course But for how long Repeated stress has been laid on the well-organized manner in which the riot had been instigated in general and the way in which systematic destruction had been carried out in certain localities sections of the Manek Chowk area looks as if it had been blasted by bombs Residents are still searching the debris for the remains of their missing relatives Sixteen houses accommodating 23 amines belonging to the minor companies have been reduced to rubble being systematically looted urbane of the houses of the community surrounding the 6 Muslim houses that were have even slightly damaged Manek Chowk is far away from Abdul Karim the centre of the trouble where the funeral descended with Bhuras jody And yet the riot at Manek howk began almost simultaneously with the one at Chauraha Abdul adjacent to the 6 houses that have been burnt down and blasted with the help of exaccording to eyewitnesses in its own story By all accounts The building houses branch of the The rear wall of the dharamshala broken It said it was torn low after the start of the riot to easy access to the houses under attack The current political mudslinging to be something old smoke for the possible economic mo behind the riot say soma citizens and AMU student leaders They suggest that the rising property values in some poorer sex ions of the town could be factor or the destruction of the houses the present riot as in previous and In support of their contention they ite what happened first in 1961 and then in 1971 in part of -Aliarh which is charmingly called the VfamU Bhanja uncle nephew In both -these riots separated1 by decade miserable hovels of poor were obliterated and in their place has come up prosperous commercial centre Unless determined steps are taken to make sure that the victims of the present riot are helped to rebuild their houses there is every danger that history might repeat itself.
