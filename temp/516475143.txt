Aligarh revisited-I Aligarh revisited-I 2 faces of communal carnage Bv and AM SEN ALIGARH November 20 THE creeping communal in this district has been spreading inch by inch leaving trail of bitterness Last month it struck Manek Chowk This month it hit Sarai Kaba Aligarh was reeling under the malignant impact of the October 5 riot when we first visited it Since then it has been virtually laid low by the renewed bout of communal frenzy of November 6 thus paralysing the district administration's efforts to restore peace and comfort the victims of the carnage Ironically until October 5 Manek Chowk used to be held up as an example of communal amity About 40 houses inhabited by about 200 Muslims formed an island in the midst of Hindu-dominated area The Muslims for the main part were# musicians and they were often called upon to play at Hindu wedding ceremonies Both communities lived in harmony Came the October 5 orgy of violence loot and arson and its math Today no more than 20 residents remain in the Muslim locality although of the 40 houses only 16 were burnt down Even the owners of the houses which are still intact have locked these up and fled to other areas of the town they consider safe Mutual distrust between the two main communities is palpable LAND SHARKS Indeed it has been aggravated by the inability of the Muslims to pick up the threats of their shattered lives at Manek Chowk especially because of the suspicion that some land sharks have an eye on the Muslim properties especially the land on which they are built According to Mr Badruddin one of the few remaining Muslim tants of Manek Chowk attempts were made as far back as 1960 to buy him out Though he resisted them these offers were renewed periodically Pressed for money he had sold portions of his To one of his brothers Mr Badruddin's portion of the house was blitzed in the October riot The only reason he can still stay on in Manek Chowk is that he has been given shelter by his brother The brothers part of the house miraculously escaped the flames As it happens the owners of the Muslim houses which have escaped destruction have again started receiving discrete offers by potential buyers But significantly and not unexpectedly the prices now are lower than ever before. This is confirmed by Mr Shiv Hari Singhal Janata party leader and president of the Bar Association who alleges that cinema hall-owner with influential connections in the ruling party may be behind the renewed offers The cinema in question today stands on land once occupied by poor Muslims The land was vacated. during previous communal riot The back gate of the hall opens out on the section of Manek Chowk affected by the October 5 riots The positioning of the back gate it is no secret had been the source of an intense controversy few months ago and continued on Page 5 Column 1 Army grenades used by rioters in Aligarli Continued from Page 1 Column 4 had thus been linked with the October 5 riot It can perhaps be argued that Manek Chowk might have been spared its misery had its location been less attractive than it is As it happens the chowk with its old crumbling houses has become something of a obstruction to Aligarhs fast-growing commercial area No wonder allegations of landgrab involving more cinema-owners than orte are flying around and different sections of the Janata party are accusing each other of nefarious designs When the second riot started exactly a month after the first says Mr Badruddin fresh attempts were made to drive away from Manek Chowk the remaining population But the provincial armed constabulary though widely criticised for its conduct elsewhere stood its ground in Manek Chowk Indeed in the words of Mr Badruddin it played a stellar role in chasing away mischief- makers and saying Manek Chowk from being en in the flames of communal fire once again This achievement is all the more creditworthy because unlike the one month earlier the November 6 riot had begun close to Manek Cowk though its worst impact was felt quite some distance away in Sarai Kaba arid Sarai Miya two adjacent areas with mixed jo Hindu and Muslims MISERABLE EXISTENCE Neither of these reas was disturbed during any communal riot for as long as one can remember But this time some poor Hindus belonging to Scheduled Caste called Koli bore the brunt of communal violence Like the Muslims of Manek Chowk the oldest of Sarai aba and Sarai Miya eke out miserable existence usually as blacksmiths in the Jock manufacturing trade for which the town is famous The latest riots began around 3 pm on November 6 Fazhad All and Mirza Laddan who are not even residents of Aligarh were squabbling over money matters in the Phool Chauraha area when Mirza Laddan sought to settle the issue by ripping open. Fazhad stomach Fazhad holding on to his gaping wound ran towards the Bani Israilian area inhabited originally by followers of Hazrat Israil the leader of Muslim sect but now housing members of the Ansari clan the majority of whom are in business The incensed residents of this area automatically assumed that their community was once again under attack meanwhile they had ered into the Hindu- Dominated Sarafa Bazar housing jewellers Residents of this area seeing blood-stained knife in his hands jumped to the conclusion that fanatics within the minority community were on the rampage Rumours spread fast and freefor-all ensued The residents of Bani Israelian and Sarafa Bazar gave vent to their lury with the help of bricks stones and other missiles At the same time snipers wielding both licensed and illicit guns soon started operating from roof-tops Curfew was imposed on the town shortly after 5 pm The curfew continued the next day large number of people from the two affected areas. were arrested either for violation of curfew or on suspicion of being involved in the riot or as precautionary measure sizable crowd of burqa lad women gheroed the demanding either that their menfolk be freed or they too be arrested The administration retreated before this display of woman power and released their men on personal bonds But the situation only worsened The town was rocked by explosions bullets crackers and improvised inmaterial throughout the night of November 7 No one seems to have slept that night There was pitched battle at Sarai Sultani between the two communities narrow winding lanes of the area echoed to the blast of explosives Indian Army hand grenades procured from no one knows where were used in the guerilla war in this area Two unexploded grenades were subsequently handed over to the authorities Eight people were injured miraculously no one died On November 8 the district authorities inexplicably decided to lift the curfew early in the morning Fresh violence erupted while according to some the district officials heatedly defeated whether or not the curfew should have been withdrawn Junior officials were said to have created further confusion by periodically lifting and reimposing the curfew and announcing their contradictions over loudspeakers mounted on their jeeps The first casualty took place within minutes of lifting the curfew banana seller Kallu Quereshi ventured out of his house in Sarai Miya to sell his goods at neighbouring Sarai Kaba He was promptly stabbed The curfew was reimposed in this area by the sector magistrate official debate over the curfew continued The curfew was again lifted in the Sarai Kaba area and this time Hindu was stabbed The mob set fire to 16 establishments belonging to the Kolis and looted seven PAC contingent posted at this spot broke the doors of school climbed to the rooftop and opened fire Five people all of them Muslims were killed in the firing and this by itself has since become source of bickering and dispute Some people believe that had the PAC not acted promptly in opening fire the entire area would have been reduced to ashes and many more would have got killed But according to others the PAC fired indiscriminately killing innocent people including lame boys on crutches They alleged that several people were killed on their rooftops while no one in the mob below was hit This is countered by others with the pertinent query as to what the men on rooftops were doing at times when the normal instinct of everyone ought to have been to take cover Another source of controversy and conjecture is the death of three Kolis in mysterious bombs blast while some people say the Kolis were killed while manufacturing bombs in their workshops others that the bomb was flung Inside their house by the rioting mob To be concluded devastated home in Serai Kaba an area inhabited by Kolis and which was the target of mob fury on November 8 TOI
