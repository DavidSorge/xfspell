The Kashmir Crisis Confusion In The Valley By KASHMIR today presents picture of confusion that has overtaken all sections of the people and the administration Only two things seem clear One is that the Bakshi Ministry will Vinvo ito work nut nut tn Fftin sizable measure of popular support The other is that Kashmir's permanent status must be determined without undue delay Had the coup against Sheikh Abdullah not because it is easy to imagine what kind of situation India may have been faced with Sheikh Abdullah without constantly wanting to do so may have found himself leading mass  the cry for independence which would have made the position of the Indian Army most delicate one INCREDIBLE If there is any implication here that the coup was organised by India because of the obvious dangers of allowing Sheikh Abdullah to carry on with his independence propaganda let me reject it at once Incredible though it seems New Delhi had no hand in it to the last advice to the Kashmir leaders want to patch up their differences Nor does there seem to be good evidence that Sheikh Abdullah himself was preparing coup of his own though of course this is theory that has been widely publicised The Bakshi regime has openly hinted that it was question of who acted first had Sheikh Abdullah and his followers not been put away his political opponents would have been Whatever Sheikh Abdullah may have adopted ultimately this certainly could not have been contemplated by him as an immediate necessity. In the first place if that was his intention he could not have demanded the resignation of Mr Sham Lai Saraf fully knowing that the Cabinet was not with him He would have taken steps not to arouse unnecessary suspicion till his plans were ready Prom reports now filtering through it must be open to doubt that the Saraf episode had anything to do with the broader issue of Kashmir's future There seems reason to believe that the Saraf resignation had been demanded by Sheikh Abdullah on valid grounds of administrative efficiency but whether Sheikh Abdullah was right in demanding Mr Saraf resignation its result could only have been to secure for him safe majority in the Cabinet Having let his opponents in the Cabinet realise the full implications of this action it was not likely that Sheikh Abdullah would have gone away to Gulmarg for the week-end according to previous programme were he thinking in terms of coup It seems even less that he could have gone away if he had the slightest suspicion that plot was being hatched against him New Delhi was certainly not posted on all that was going on What happened was that the Abdullah opposition took matters in its own hands and decided to face the Government of India with fait accompli to which the denial of Its support would have been highly difficult and even dangerous The differences within the Kashmir Cabinet which were used as an excuse for the coup were therefore not an issue of principle though his recent difficulties with India were used as ready-made to make his ousting acceptable in India Perhaps these are not relevant factors Sheikh Abdullah was certainly without majority in the Cabinet His support both in the Constituent Assembly and the National Conference had dwindled It is nevertheless pity that the break could not have come on clear issue of policy WARNING There is much. over-simplification of the immediate result of the coup It has too automatically been concluded that there was relief in the anti-Independent Kashmir camp This is neither true nor was it to be expected in view of Sheikh Abdullah's unquestioned leadership of more than 20 years myself found much heart-searching even among National Conference workers who did not see eye to eye with Sheikh Abdullah in his new tendencies The General Secretary of the National Conference Maulana Mohammed Saeed Masudi himself an opponent of Sheikh Abdullah on the Independent Kashmir issue typified the reaction of many in the party when he warned those who launder misconception that by indulging in mud-throwing -at Sheikh Abdullah they are serving the cause of Kashmir and India It should be remembered that the people whose feelings are sought to be roused and catered to are not to decide the future of Kashmir. It is the people of the State themselves who are the final arbiters of their destiny and it is their feelings and their interests that should be kept in mind if their sym is not to be alienated Nevertheless do not doubt that Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed's majority in the Constituent Assembly or in the party is in danger only doubt that these majorities will be valid enough to be set against his apparently moderate backing among the mass of the people. As for the feelings of the masses the suddenness of the coup which displaced Sheikh Abdullah took them completely by surprise The first reaction which led to the firing in Srinagar on Sunday evening was for the people to come out in the streets and demonstrate against the visible instruments of Government It was spontaneous outburst of feeling but it was diffused and without direction WAR COUNCIL What came later was more organized form of resistance Stories began to filter through of road blocks and the cutting of telegraph wires But even now the organization of resistance has not reached an adstage of preparation body styling itself the War Council has come into being in Srinagar saw some of its posters calling for the overthrow of the Bakshi regime The posters were at pains to keep Pakistan out of it The cry was of Kashmir for the Kashmiris This is perhaps not just tactic for the posters also warned against communal approach and there have been no communal incidents of any kind during week of high feeling and rising passion Srinagar itself presents rather misleading picture of the valleys agitated mood The new town west of Amira Kadal makes brave and not wholly unsuccessful pretence of business usual The shops are open and people move about freely though there is noticeable heaviness in their tread Occasionally there are shouts across The Bound of Sher-eKashmir Zindabad Bakshi Wazaret Murdabad As night falls the shouting becomes more persistent But in the old city of the seven bridges the protest is deeper The pulse of life has slowed down The shops are all closed through here and there an occasional clandestine deal takes place through half open shutter The streets are empty except for few conspiratorial knots of people in odd corners The rare visitor from outside causes flutter Heads peep from behind the small windows very inquisitive silently resentContinued on page 10 col 5# TASK AHEAD OF NEW REGIME Kashmir Crisis 4 Continued from page 6 col 5# full Every now and then groups of urchins suddenly appear from lanes you did not suspect were there and in half-broken voices the shrill cry goes out Sher-e Kashmir Zindabad In the countryside it was the same story went to Anantnag the morning of the firing in which three people were killed Anantnag looked for all the world like an abandoned town Police and militia pickets went about their rounds in desolate streets. On the road to Anantnag we passed through Pampur Awantipur and Khannabal There had been no incidents in these towns There was lathi charge in Pampur but that came after we had passed For all that the towns had the same air as in Anantnag of an overhanging tragedy The shops except few were all closed and there was sullen rein the faces of the few stragglers in the streets The task before the Bakshi Ministry is formidable one do not refer to the law and order situation That may be adequately dealt with. But the task of winning popular favour will be much stiffer POPULAR SUPPORT It is fair to point out that the pro-Bakshi elements were also taken by surprise by the suddenness of the events They are now rallying round the Government more purposefully National Conference workers have begun tours of the countryside to explain to the people the issues behind the overthrow of Sheikh Abdullah There were also gratifying demonstrations by sections of the people in support of the new regime showing at least that the propaganda initiative was not to be allowed to rest with the pro-Abdullah factions But let us not fool ourselves about the problem in Kashmir it may seem the way of patriotism in the short run but it will not make for wise solution Nor is it necessary to run to the other conclusion that our weakness is Pakistan's strength In the pro-Abdullah groups there is no decisive inclination towards either independence for Kashmir or accession to Pakistan All that they are concerned to show at the moment is their faith in Sheikh Abdullah.
