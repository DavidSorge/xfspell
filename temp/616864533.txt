dismissal of the former senior superintendent of police Mr Karanvir Singh under whose supervision the firing was carried out and the officials of the Mantola police station who participated in the He has also demanded compensation for the families of the deceased and the injured The indefinite curfew which was imposed on December 14 following the first incident of rioting has severely affected the two main trades of the city shoes and tourism Every seventh person in Agra who has population of 14 lakhs is dependent either directly or indirectly on tourism according to Mr Arun Dang convenor of the Tourism Guild of Agra The curfew and the closure of the Taj Mahal caused severe loss to the tourism industry It led to frantic cancellation of tours by foreigners Some of them told Mr Dang of rumours doing the rounds in Pakistan that the monument had been totally destroyed The emporia and hotels are suffering loss of Rs 26 lakhs per day in foreign exchange pie earnings of the two. together Rs 30 lakhs per day during the peak season Presently the earnings are about Rs 2 lakhs Mr Dang said Normally by December every year the 1500 to 1600 hotel rooms in Agra are 90 per cent full but this year the occupancy is not even 10 per cent Mr Dang pointed out There have been extensive cancellations of bookings till January 31 next year The shoe industry which provides employment about 35 per cent of the city's population has also suffered severe blow While the factories are owned mainly by the Vishyas Agand Guptas besides some Punjabis and Sindhis the artisans are mostly Muslims or Jatavs said shoe factory owner Mr Mr Qureshi Most of the shoe manufacturers here supply to companies such as Carona and Bata We had to meet their demand by December 23 which we failed to as result we are facing massive cancellation of orders Even European shoe companies which place orders around Christmas time have backed out laments Mr Qureshi Even as the riot-torn city was gradually returning to normal this week some reasons for the outbreak of violence were surfacing News leaked out that the first victim of the riot Dashrath 35-year-old employee of the Sarjini Nagar Hospital was not stabbed by Muslim but by group of Hindu fanatics by mistake who now seemed to be repenting that they had killed many of their own community Meanwhile youths armed with hockey sticks spears daggers and sometimes even guns continue to guard especially during the night To travel from one mohalla to another is like passing from one tribal zone to another where you are not allowed to proceed without being thoroughly scrutinised or challenged depending on the mood of the guards
