Belgaum inured to violence clashes By Oaknel Vaz The Times of India News Service BANGALORE April 18 FOR some years now the people of Belgaum have almost become inured to violence and group clashes which have tendency of erupting periodically at the slightest provocation in this sensitive border city Unlike in the past when the city faced clashes over the Karnataka-Maharashtra border dispute on the KannadaMarathi language row and even an occasional communal clash as had happened just last year Belgaum had to undergo traumatic experience this month Belgaum literally burnt and bled for well over week during which period as many as nine persons lost their lives scores of people sustained serious injuries hundreds of houses business and commercial establishments were gutted besides private and public vehicles resulting in an estimated loss of about Rs 15 to Rs 2 crores Apparently the fires have now died down No untoward incidents have been reported since last Monday and the city is slowly coming back to life However while the entire city has been put under prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC till April 22 parts of the city are still under curfew continuously during nights for the last 1 1 days Belgiums latest woes were sparked off by rather minor incident youth on his way home after seeing movie was stabbed over money dispute by three inebriated youngsters on April 6 night The victim succumbed to his injuries in the hospital next day It was after the funeral that Belgium lost its sanity as people belonging to the victims community started indiscriminately attacking and stabbing those belonging to the other community with knives and choppers Natthis invited retaliatory response and the city became battleground with mob mentality taking over anti-social elements and vested interests who resorted to arson looting and rioting had field-day The cause of the orgy of violence which ultimately took on communal colour is thus pretty obvious But one wonders. whether the gory incidents could have been averted There is also the nagging suspicion regarding the forces behind the carnage unleashed on the city for days together By all accounts the police authorities were well aware of the identity of the culprits who first ignited the tinderbox Had they acted swiftly and arrested the trio perhaps the mob-fury could have been kept under check But evidently the police were afraid to act decisively as the culprits were related to Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti MES lady corwho in turn owes her allegiance to powerful MES leader When the culprits were finally nabbed the situation was already out of control Yet another disquieting aspect of the entire sordid affair was the mysterious bomb blast that took place in busy residential locality near Fort. road on Friday last killing three persons including 9-year-old girl and seriously injuring the owner of the building besides 10 others The explosion occurred in the bathroom of two-storeyed building There are different versions as to how the bomb came to be there While some claim that the bomb was thrown by people belonging to the rival community others disagree and argue that it must have. acexploded while under preparation The state forensic experts who rushed to Belgium from Bangalore to inspect the blast site under the leadership of Dr Mohan director of Forensic Science Laboratory on Monday have already collected samples from the debris While their analysis report is yet to come in informed sources contend that it could have been country bomb Meanwhile the Corps Of Detectives COD team led by Mr BN Nagaraj COD director is also conducting its investigation into the various cases registered in connection with the Belgaum riots In the past when Belgaum witnessed violent incidents The police were able to quickly quell the trouble even during the worst riots over the border issue When the city went through communal clashes during the Ganesha idol immersion in September last year the situation was brought under check within day But this is perhaps the first time that the city had to undergo prolonged bout of violent incidents and continuous curfew lasting 1 1 days in row while the government and other authorities concerned would be undoubtedly making efforts to find out what went wrong and why and try to fix responsibility there are various theories and speculations who exactly is behind the latest flareup There are who argue that the internal dissension within the MES ranks which resulted in Kannadiga being elected as Mayor of Belgium for the first time last year may have been contributory factor with rival factions trying to settle scores Through all sides tend to underplay the role of political parties political involvement and even support is not entirely ruled out However there is another explanation doing the rounds which perhaps appears quite plausible The Belgium civic body is presently in the process of finalising its master plan for the city The draft plan which has been already approved by the civic body is awaiting formal clearance from the state government Once the plan gets the green signal the land-owners in the old city areas will have tough time in taking possession of their properties from tenants who have been occupying either their dwelling or business places for years together who would really mind if these old buildings and structures which in any case were fetching paltry rentals get destroyed in the riots with the exception of the tenants Is it strange coincidence that most of the buildings that were destroyed were located in the old portions of the city or were some other extraneous forces conveat work For the moment however peace and normalcy is returning to Belgium But will the sore wounds left behind by the violent incidents heal and the bitter memories of the past fortnight fade quickly The city is bracing up with trepidation when yet another event The Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti which has potential for arousing passions is to be celebrated next month.
