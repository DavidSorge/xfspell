Amarsinh weakness exposed By ASHRAF SAVED The Times of India News Service AHMEDABAD July 14 THE latest communal carnage in JGujarat which has claimed over 50 lives in the state capital alone so far has driven the Amarsinh Chaudhary government to the wall with total breakdown in ihp law and situation The clashes between the police and the people and police firings to quell mob attacks during the Last six days have become so frequent that it is baffling to say the least why the administration has been hesitating to summon the army The state administration appears to have been benumbed in the face of the violence spreading to new areas every day The government observers say could have nipped the trouble in the bud on July 9 when violence broke out as the annual rather yatra procession was being taken out The government and the police in particular had enough indications that the violence was likely to spread to the industrial belt of this textile city Yet they did nothing to prevent this There has been destruction of public and private property on an enormous scale not to mention the mounting toll of life Authoritative sources say detailed report was submitted to the chief. minister week before the rath yatra procession pointing out the sensitive areas on the route and the likely organisations and persons who might engineer trouble But the government satisfied itself. with taking only routine measures which in the end proved most ineffective According to these sources in addition to the initial hesitancy on the part of the authorities in dealing firmly with the trouble-makers the weak political leadership the partisan feelings in the police force and the increasing bigotry among both Hindu and Muslim leaders are the factors responsible for the continuing clashes in Ahmedabad Baroda Broach and other parts of the state In the last one year of the Amarsh ministry's rule at least 20 communal incidents have place in Nadiad Bhuj Palanpur Veraval Baroda Broach Bhavnagar Palitana Godhra Lunawada and Devgadh-Baria to name few towns and cities In the light of this the government should have mobilised all its forces to maintain peace in the vulnerable areas but the weak political leadership failed dismally In the same way the police was equally responsible for the escalation of violence Successive agitations during the last five years have totally demoralised the police force Last years anti-reservation agitation which led to casteist and communal clashes has the police force The cancer of casteism and communalism has spread among the lower ranks of the constabulary In the current communal clashes at many places either the police became passive and watched the situation or abetted with the criminals Another baffling aspect was the use of private firearms Even after repeated combing operations the police have not been able to unearth sizable quantities of hidden arms and ammunition The participation of the textile workers in the Gujarat Bandh on Saturday has not only surprised but stunned the leadership of the Major Mahajan founded by Mahatma Gandhi Considered to be the laboratory of Gandhi's experiment of nonviolence. Major Mahajan had remained aloof from any agitational path for the last seven decades But for the first time in its history all textile mills in the city remained closed in response to the bandh call Even during the height of the Nav Nirman agitation in 1974 and in the subsequent anti-reservation agitation the textile workers had not abstained from work even for days. The latest development has puzzled the Mahajan leadership which believes that only concerted propaganda could have led the workers to participate in the bandh The decline in the influence of the Mahajan leadership over the Industrial work force is attributed to its inactiveness on the political front For the past few years the Mahajan has stopped contesting elections This has deprived the leadership of live contact at The grassroots level The void thus created in the labour belt of the city has been effectively filled by the BJP-led unions This also explains the large-scale violence in the labour-dominated areas as the Gandhian influence of the Mahajan has considerably declined over the years Some Hindu leaders blame the Central government for arousing the feelings of the Hindu masses They blame Mr Rajiv Gandhi for openly appeasing Muslim fundamentalists on the issue of the Shah Bano case Many Hindu organisations in Gujarat like elsewhere in the country have become very active and started propaganda on big scale All these issues combined to incite the communal violence The question now is how to control and effectively curb this insensation violence If the past record of the Amarsinh ministry is any indicating many doubt that it would be able to do it immediately The escape of the notorious terrorist Harbinder Singh alias Jinda from police custody casteist clashes at Golana and Kalol and the recurring communal riots are all pointing to the fact that the Amarsinh ministry is losing its grip over the law and order situation In addition, top police officers are divided in number of groups which has demoralised the rank and file during the five-month-long antireservation agitation over 230 people were killed but the latest cycle of violence has taken toll of over SO lives in just six days That indicates the intensity of the clashes in and around the city This calls for drastic change in the police force and stringent government action to assert its hand Virtually the entire city is under curfew and it is anybody's guess what will happen when it is lifted And if the government still dithers on calling in the army to restore law and order it will only have itself to blame for the consequences
