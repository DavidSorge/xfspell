Temple is very much on BIP agenda Kalrai By Arvind Singh Bisht The Times of India News Service LUCKNOW While Parliament continues to witness stalemate over Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayees remark on the Ayodhya issue the UP unit of the BJP does not seem to be unduly perturbed by the scathing criticism of the opposition pointer to this came when state BJP chief Kaliaj Mishra admitted that Ayodhya was very much on the party's agenda talking to this paper he clarified The BJP is committed to pave the way for the construction of the Ram temple if it gets absolute a majority at the Centre He said the BJP was only concerned with the legal hurdles and not with the construction of the Ram temple which he said was on the agenda of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP and the Ram Janaro Bhoomi. Nyas When asked what the BJP stand would be if the VHP as per its plan chose to announce the temple programme during the Kumbh festival in Allahabad beginning next month he said we would talk to them and ensure that law and order is maintained in the state In any case the ongoing controversy would have no impact on the fate of the state government which he said would complete the rest of its term. Mr Mishra reaction came after chief minister Rajnath Singh dared the opposition to bring no confidence motion against the Vajpayee government if it was against the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya Lambasting the opposition for creating ruckus over Mr Vajpayees statement in Parliament Mt Mishra said that it was nothing but an attempt to woo Muslims. He added that the opposition parties particularly the Samajwadi Party and the Congress wanted to create communal tension in UP by raising the Ayodhya issue and this was evident from the recent clashes in Moradabad and Rae Bareli The BJP. he said did not want to rake up the issue for two reasons First the BJP was part of the ruling National Democratic Alliance NDA at the centre which had excluded the Ayodhya issue from its agenda and secondly it did not want to extract political mileage out of it as was not merely political issue but social one as well When asked whether the BJP would contest its next election on the Ayodhya issue or not Mr Mishra said it was for the party's central leadership to decide All that can say is that it will depend on the emerging situation he observed
