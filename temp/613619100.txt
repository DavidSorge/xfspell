Politicians behind Gujarat stir NEW DELHI June 9 THREE-MEMBER fact-finding team of the Editors Guild India has found that the in Gujarat has been the creation of politicians of all shades and we are persuaded that the trouble in Ahmedabad was aggravated by groups in the major political parties including the Congress There is ample evidence to indicate that some members of the Bharatiya Janata. Party and the Janata Party were also involved in the agitation against the increase in reservations the team said in its inquiry report The group which visited Atoedabad for three days early May. met politicians officials journalists lawyers and intellectuals consisted of Mr Harintfra Dave Mr Kuldip Nayar and Mr Sabay It found that at the root of the trouble in Gujarat had been politics of low order leading to an administrative vacuum for at least few tours on April 22 ROUE The report said the chief minister Mr Madhav Sinh Solaaki himself played politics just before the state assembly poll he announced an additional 18 per cent reservation for the backward classes This was only a ploy to attract votes because the chief minister took no steps to implement bits announcement The team noted that earlier the Bne commission report had been irrepartially but the recommendation that economic means and not caste should be the test of backwardness was rejected The team found some substance in the argument that certain government quarters engineered communal riots to divert attention from the caste conflict and the anti-reservation agitation Summing up its findings It observed the misuse of the police for party or political ends has implied an erosion of discipline in the police in Gujarat so much so on April 22 the policemen went berattacked newspaper and individuals and the totally collapsed at least for few hours It found that the attack on the Gujarat Samachar and on was premeditated The culprits acted safe in the Knowledge that an attack on the Gujarat Samachar would go shed in view of the strained relations between the chief minister and the Gujarat Samachar That the police had hand in the attack on the Gujarat Samachar is proved by an audio cassette on which police conversation on wireless is recorded said the team It had the cassette in its possession The cassette's genuineness it said was indirectly confirmed by senior police officers who narrated much that was contained in it without knowing that we had the cassette in our possession The report said we have no doubt in our minds that the attack on the Gujarat Samachar was meticulously planned It came in three waves The first attack was by the police which prevented the fire brigade from the fire in the press for some time The second attack came later in the evening from sections about. whose identity we are not sure and it completed the task left unfinished by the police The last attack from surrounding neighbours was not that serious and was repulsed The team said the Western Tunes perhaps got attacked because it was housed in the same complex The army prevented an attack on the Indian Express and Janasatta building The team members were told that the police had plans to attack judges too but the presence of the army prevented further loss of life and property On the role of the press it said that the press especially in critical times must show sense of balance proportion and its concern for public interest Personal feuds or rivalries must not influence professional judgments and action The team was told by independent persons whose opinion we would value that the Gujarat Samachar did overplay news concerning police and the anti-reservation agitation The report said some readers had considered Gujarat Samachar reports to be exaggerated but few except administrators had accused it of manufacturing news The team concluded that whatever view one may hold on the performance of the press in Gujarat on the reservation issue the police attack on the Gujarat Samachar or other newspaper offices and on journalists photographers and workers of newspapers just cannot be Justified It said the government should come in full for the damage
