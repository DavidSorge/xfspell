BSP likely to gain from Urdu issue By RATTAN MALL The Times of India News Service mrw The party that is likely to stand to gain from the Badaun riots in western Urdu being the second official language status is the Bahujan Samal Party History favours this The October 1961 communal riots which started from the Aligarh Muslim University and spread to Meerut and Moradabad districts had led to coalition between the Harijans and the Muslims under the Republican Party of India The result was that the Republican Party won as many as eight seats with 38 per cent of the total votes cast in the 1962 assembly erections The party's Victory was contended to western districts Badaun Aligarh Agra and Moradabad These districts had large Muslim populations and in three of them scheduled castes were The largest Hindu caste group Five of the MLAs were Scheduled Pastes and the remaining three Muslims What is more four of the live Scheduled Paste MLAs were actually returned from general constitution urban Muslim votes were crucial factor in these elections and three of the constituencies were urban while two others were partly urban Till the 1961 riots in which 36 people were killed mostly Muslims in the political situation was quite different with both Muslims and Scheduled Castes regarding the Congress as their godfather In fact until the 1962 elections the Republican Party or its predecessor the Scheduled Caste federation had achieved no success in UP Following the riots the Republicans formed alliances with conservative Muslims in the western districts In fact the election campaign was so vitriolic in its communalism that an election tribunal had to overturn the result in the Aligarh city assembly constituency where Muslim candidate of the Republican party had won The situation evidently remained unchanged over the next five years for the Republican Party increased the percentage of its votes marginally from 38 to 41 per cent and its seats to nine These included die seat from Badaun In some cies the Republican party candidates came second with substantial percentage of votes But this movement faded out with Muslims and Scheduled Castles evidently turning back to the Congress as party as such few MLAs could never hope to give its supporters the type of benefits the ruling party could However the Scheduled Castes turned back to Harijan-based party in 1985 they voted heavily in many assembly constituencies for the Bahtijah Samaj Party led by Mr Kanshi Ram Yet though the BSP polled four per cent of the total votes it could not get single seat This was quite evidently because it did not forge an alliance with the Muslims like the Republican Party had done The BSPs strong showing in many assembly and parliamentary by-elections since then as well known But the message is very clear if it does not ally itself with the Muslims or some other group in UP in an overall state assembly election it is highly unlikely to bag enough seats to emerge veritable force to reckon with But the writing on the wall is loud and clean the BSP stands to gain substantially in the Agra-Aligarh-Badaun-Moradabad region in view of the latest situation there.
