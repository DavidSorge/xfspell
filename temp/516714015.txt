CARNAGE AT CARNAGE AT Simmering hatred led to violence By JYOTI PUNWANI BOMBAY February 3 AROUND 2 am on January 8 room in one of Jogeshwaris numerous was set on fire Inside were nine persons of five were burnt to death One succumbed later Two of them were husband and wife Rajaram and Sulochana Bane aged 55 and Two others were mother and daughter Kamiabai Batlu and Laxmi aged 32 and 16. respectively One was handicapped girl Meenakshi Narkar aged 20 Vandana Kondalkar 30 succumbed later while her two children aged 5 and 11 escaped with minor burns According to the Shiv Sena this was the spark that set off the attacks on Muslims all over the city Is this claim true Why did it happened Why weren't the victims saved There seems to be no apparent reason for the act The Banes whose home was burnt were among the oldest residents of Gandhi chawl near Radhabai police hence the misconception that it was Radhabai Chawl Mr Rajaram Bane had bought the room even before he was married. for Rs 50 worker in Sigma paints Andheri his world was his home and his work Shiv Sena supporter because they helped him in his factory he had no inclination for either their meetings or their mahaHis wife did not work nor did his daughter Naina 26 who survived the fire Of his two sons 3ne has temporary job The Banes were among those who had refused to shift to Hindu area and offer many of their neighbours took up when it was made by the local Sena corporator Mr Waman Raginwar in 1973 after first riot In all the five riots that had seen we were never All these years whenever we would discuss moving out of our neighbours would tell us that they were with us says Maina Since they were among the oldest residents some of their neighbours thought it fit to move in with them that night Violence had already out in the adjoining areas in just two hours before their home was burnt group of boys had tried to barge into their neighbours room disappearing after her screams alerted the neighbours The neighbour Vandana Konand her two kids also moved in with the Banes All of them escaped with Naina but only the children survived The mysterious incident can be partially understood if seen as part of the chain of events set into motion after the December 6 Ayodhya demolition Like elsewhere in Bombay Muslims in Jogeshwari also came out on the street on December 7 destroying public property reaction was also similar police firing After four of them were killed some of the boys wrecked two police in the area with the full support of their parents The final death roll in police firing was nine An advocate handling the release of the 121 Muslims arrested in the recent violence describes the Gandhi Chawl incident as time for police firing Jogeshwari was the venue of the city's first few mahaOn January 1 Saturday the first one in the area was held at the station And just a few hours before the Bane home was burnt one more had concluded in Shankarwadi Hindu area in the suburb Mr A Khan additional commissioner of police who has arrested six of the dozen-odd boys responsible for the deed says that it was done as reaction to the maha-aarti The boys two of whom had been arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act TADA during the 1991 riots in the area had not planned to go that far says Mr Khan They had wanted to give the Hindus scare he said mahabrough with them the violence which has become their trademark On January 6 bakery adjacent to the Jogeshwari police station compound and few Muslims huts in Chachanagar were set on fire On January 7 from 930 pm to midnight few hours before the Gandhi Chawl incident the two communities were throwing stones at each other in the nearby Pathan Chawl Muslim home there was 1 set on fire burnt as completely as 1 the Banes The inmates had into neighbour place Hence it wasnt as though suddenly out of the blue some criminals as Mr Khan calls them decided to burn Hindu home violence between the communities had already begun Whatever the motive it was largely communal No builder could hope to construct anything on the remnants of the Banes room or even on the narrow street which houses the Hindu families who have all run away from the chawl Around 250 families from the area are being looked after by the Senas local corporators in Meghwadi Hindu area of the suburb They were evacuated by the corporators led by Mr Ravindra Waikar and by the police They have no desire to return even though the homes next to the Banes are untouched They want to be resettled in Hindu locality and have already identified the plot earmarked for garden Jogeshwari also haven for The former Congress corporator Mr Ashraf Amin Shaikh had host of criminal charges against him including murder The Sena has very strong presence there with activists ranging from bank employees to lumpens The ordinary citizen has no inclination to invite the wrath of criminals of either side More significantly influence of these criminals has increased over the last two years after the December 1990 and January 1991 communal riots which saw total of 1 1 dead Till the 1991 riots the youth of the two communities remained friends even if superficially but 1991 changed that and resulted in total breakdown of communication between the two communities with even veteran political workers hesitating to venture to the other side Since then the two communities who live largely in clearly deareas separated by street or by the Western Express highway have been like enemy Border skirmishes are routine in every riot But this time damage was done right in the heart of the Muslim which would not have been possible say the Muslims had the police not let the Sena boys in Without their help not even 1 0000 of them could have dared to enter our area they say Their hatred for the police has grown with every riot Interestingly Naina Bane could think of only one factor which annoyed their Muslim neighbours We used to give the policemen who so often patrolled our street water After all they were hardly likely to ask Muslims for water when Marathi people were there The Muslims objected to that Added her brother They we were police informers However the local police at least until 1991 have been equally tolerant of criminals of both communities The 1991 riots saw major reshuffle in the local police.
