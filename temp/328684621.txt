Election Broadcasts By BHATIA HAVING insisted only few months ago on facilities for her Deputy High Commissioner in Dacca to visit Gopalganj for personal report on the earlier rioting that India could not have denied the Pakistani High Commissioner in New Delhi similar opportunity with regard to Aligarh Formal permission for such visits in either country is sought only for reasons of diplomatic. courtesy and to prevent the impression that an unfortunate situation such as the one in East Pakistan or in UP is being exploited for political ends Yet political motives cannot be said to be totally absent in the solicitude shown by either Government for the principal minority community in the other country There is also without doubt the element of genuine concern in India and Pakistan about the effect which communal rioting may have on the innocent minority on the other side No Government worth the name can bear with equanimity the prospect of serious faces at home as result of communal passion across the frontier personal appraisal such as the one that has been undertaken by the Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan can help his own Government to see the recent occurrences in UP right his mission should be welcomed than criticised While the current practice in India and Pakistan of showing public interest in the other country's largest national minority is clearly odd it is an inescapable consequence of the historical process under which the sub-continent was partitioned and of the mutual suspicion under which both India and Pakistan have been living for the past 14. years THE WORST Of all the absurd reasons which have led to communal cities in our own country the events Aligarh were surely among the worst Blame must attach to those who had the responsibility of immediately countering the series of rumours which subsequently created destructive panic in other parts of the State At the same time the Central Government is far from convinced by the hasty verdict of the State Home Minister that the riots were organised by nameless political party In no case does this unambiguous charge absolve the administration which was clearly found napping when plot was being cooked up under its nose of very important obligation The search for scapegoats bears an unmistakably political slant real danger which must not be ignored at the moment lies in the possibility of further communal disorder on the eve of the general election or during the poll We have so far been blessed with an excellent record over the counting of heads during the previous two generals elections Unfortunately since -the UP riots have been linked with efforts by communal organisations in the country to divert votes from the Congress party the risk is genuine that similar attempts may be made at later date Ihis would of course be shame but it would be as well for the authorities to remember that the evil process can be repeated In that then would be even less justification for UPs Home Minister about organised plotting If his own assessment is correct at this time he has already had warning whether or not India's political parties will use the radio for election campaigns now depends strangely enough not on All India Radio so much as on themselves So far as All India Radio is concerned the principle has been accepted It has now been left to the Chief Election Commissioner. to work out the necessary details in consultation with the political parties concerned This official is currently in contact with political leaders to settle formula under which election broadcasts may be made ADVANTAGE There is reason to believe that not all the political parties are equally enthusiastic over All India Radios oiler of time for election broadcasts Some are said to tear that such an innovation would in the present circumstances mainly the Congress because while there would be ready listeners for Mr Nehrus talks the leaders of most other organisations might by comparison In other words the facility for election broadcasts could very well become an additional election advantage for the Congress without bestowing an equal benefit on the others In the meantime several difficulties remain to be got over For instance there is the question of the base on which All India Radio would be asked to allot time on the air for the large variety of political parties in this country The practice in some of the other democratic countries could be helpful though the practice varies from country to country In France before the advent of General de Gaulle used to be allotted on the basis of the number of votes polled by each party In the UK it is understood the proportion is fixed on the basis of seats in the House of Commons In the USA thanks to commercial broadcasting parties can buy up time What system will India follow Before the 1957 general election in India the principle of election broadcasts was accepted by the Government but the offer of facilities by All India Radio was confined to the reading of election manifestoes For very good reasons this qualified offer was rejected by the political parties interested in furthering their election campaigns On the present occasion the Government has gone much further and each party may be permitted to put out more than one talk through spokesman of its choice The one condition. governing this concession would be that defamatory or abusive language must not be used. Since scripts would have to be submitted in advance All India Radio could make sure that the opportunity of electroadcasts is not misused for slanderous attacks on opponents Other than that safeguard All India Radio does not intend to certify any censorship Another unsolved problem so far is the question of language All India Radio will insist on the use of English for the broadcasts from New Delhi but regional languages may be used from radio stations in the States Complications may arise if regional parties also insist on time being allotted from New Delhi There will also be difficulties if all or most of the political parties interested in the next general election demand equality of treatment. with the Congress over the time allotted for each broadcast The Government's view is that such proposition cannot be accepted and that time will have to be fixed on rational basis in some sort of proportion to the importance and following of each group Final proposals will come to the Government after the Chief Election Commissioner has sorted things out with political leaders at the moment the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting can no more than wait for such proposals Now that China has signed its boundary treaties with Burma and Nepal New Delhi is naturally interested in whether Peking will proceed with the threatened ties with Pakistan for the settlement of the Kashmir frontier which divides the two countries. It is known that this question was discussed by the Secretary- General of the Indian External Affairs Ministry during his recent visit to China and it is very much hoped in New Delhi that the Chinese Government will not create further difficulty between herself and India and between India and Pakistan by going ahead with negotiations on this subject While Chinese moves cannot be predicted with any accuracy the present indications are said to be hopeful. ACUMEN King Mahendras visit to China has been followed in New Delhi with inevitable interest It is felt that the Nepalese King displayed admirable acumen and purposefulness in negotiating the Everest. issue with Peking Such details as have already become available show that Nepal's interests have not suffered from the Kings visit He was originally to have spent nearly four weeks in China but the visit was later reduced to less than three weeks at his own initiative It is probably not sufficiently appreciated in India that King Mahendra also stood his ground well during his earlier visit to Pakistan He kept strictly aloof from Indo-Pakistani disputes and resisted suggestions which he thought might arouse suspicions in India For instance Pakistan's suggestion to open diplomatic mission in Khatmandu is believed to have been politely turned down for the time being proposal by Pakistan to appoint an honorary Consul was also not accepted Details of Pakistan's suggestion to use Khatmandu as halt for her commercial flights between Karachi and Dacca still remains to be discussed
