Prospect And Retrospect Challenge Of Aligarh By PREM BHATIA has posed the first serious challenge to the efforts of national integration but the incidents at the University and their sequel also emphasise valuable moral It is not enough to come to general understanding in the conference room on the need for promoting goodwill or to define objectives Details of the campaign must be tackled. quickly and with thoroughness which would leave no room for misunderstanding or mistakes Far too often have the leaders of this country contended themselves with resolutions dripping with piety or good intentions which act as dope encouraging inaction There is far too much humbug in our approach to life serious problems From the experience provided by Aligarh Chandausi and Meerut it should also be clear that the process of integration is slow and then ing and that success will result only from honesty backed by spirit ol on The ingredient of honesty consists not only of bold examination of their own hearts by the majority community but also of courageous and objective recognition of the disease which afflicts large number of Muslims in this country Until the current vague suspicions of disloyalty are replaced by factual appraisal of sullenness diffidence or aggressive self-assertion we shall continue to chase shadows REACTION To start with it seems to be necessary not to have deeper probe into the affairs of Aligarh University than was conducted few months ago On that occasion the subject of inquiry was confined largely to certain allegations of administrative Irregularities Let us at last face facts There is widespread belief that this University is the only communal reaction that it is influenced in its day-to-day working by Mullahs of the Jamaat-i-Islami and that at least some of the staff have undesirable contacts with Pakistan It has even been said that the draft of the presidential speech at the recent Muslim Convention in New Delhi was vetted by elements at the University who are considered sympathetic to Pakistan All this may be untrue or ed Nevertheless it is time doubts were set at rest about stories of objectionable activities by some of the theologians and theoreticians at Aligarh An immediate step which the Central Government is likely to take is to find new Vale-Chancellor for the University It would be unfair to put all the blame on the present Vice-Chancellor Mr Zaidi but there is strong feeling in New Delhi that he did not prove himself up to the ksk which faced him preceding the riotous conduct by the students among the names which have been considered for his successor is Mr F-zee of Bombay He was on the Governments list of nominees even before the riot in Aligarh An earnest approach may now be made to him to take over the post of Vice-Chancellor Other consequences will almost certainly follow the incidents at Aligarh and in other UP centres Considerable political damage has been caused to the Congress party This may not be so important except that the principal beneficiaries at the next general election will be the Hindu and Muslim communal parties What happened in Jabalpur and Moradabad earlier year lost the Congress thousands of potential votes The stupid riots at Aligarh and elsewhere in UP this month may be taken to have multiplied the Hindu and Muslim vote against the Congress The Jana Sangh could not have wished for more propitious beginning for its election campaign even where the Muslim League does not exist as political the community's votes will not be willingly given to the Congress If no direct blame attaches to the Congress for these developments the party is undoubtedly guilty of inactivity and of lack of purpose But Congress disappointment at the polls will not be. The main adversity for the country What matters is the strengthening of trend which is unhealthy backward and anti-national Moral courage of another kind may be required shortly of the Congress party An ugly report now circulating in New Delhi is that the Chief Minister of one of the States has been found to put away large amounts of foreign exchange in an overseas bank. The inquiry is still at an early stage but enough is known about the case to have caused senior Congress leaders serious worry Should the worst suspicion not being entertained be established as fact the incident may well become test case of the Governments firmness As Parliament is to meet next month for its final session before the general election more is likely to be heard of the current investigation SOLICITUDE Talking of elections few Congress leaders from the States including some Chief Ministers are now said to have written to the Prime Minister suggesting that it would be unfair to allow Mr Krishira Menon in his present delicate state of health to engage himself in major battle at the polls in North Bombay They have offered alternative constituencies for Mr Krishna Menon including centres in Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir is not yet known what Mr Krishna Menon's own reaction will be to the solicitude shown by these State leaders When similar suggestion was made to him some time ago the Defence Minister turned it down saying that he did not wish to run away from difficult fight It is expelled that Mr Krishna Menon will return to New Delhi before the end of this month Behind the timing of the official 5 disclosure in New Delhi that Mr Nehrus appreciation of Mr Nasser's restrained handling of the Syrian situation was also expressed in personal message to the UAR President lies an interesting reason of practical wisdom reference to the message could very well have been made by the Prime Minister himself in the public tribute he paid to Mr Nasser in 1 Hyderabad on Tuesday when he repeated This public appreciation at Madurai taking their cue from the Prime Minister's silence on the matter officials of the External Affairs Ministry also withheld the information for four days after the message was transmitted to Cairo RISKY On Friday morning the UAR Ambassador who had cut short his home leave to return 10 his post of duty on Thursday called at the External Affairs Ministry. It was through him that the Government learnt for the first time that the Prime Minister's friendly interest had been well received by President Nasser This seemed to clear the way for publicising 1 move which had been carefully guarded so far from public knowledge Even the statement made by Mr Nehru in Hyderabad was not free from some risk announcement about the message without prior knowledge of Cairo's favourable reactions might well have been construed in that country as an unwarranted interference in the UAR internal affairs In fact some such thought must have been present in the mind of Marshal Tito who had simultaneously sent more or less identical message to President Nasser Marshal Tito had however added an understandably apologetic clause about not wishing to appear interested in matter of domestic concern to the UAR That Mr Nehrus cabled communication to President Nasser was also preceded by doubts of this kind is certain The fact that initial hesitations were quickly good over and straightforward cable was drafted carries an interesting lesson between Mr Nehru and President Nasser and on broader plane between India and the UAR has developed in the past few degrees of understanding and mutual appreciation which stood in no danger of being wrecked by the attention1 paid by the Prime Minister to the UARs Continued on Page 11 Column 3 RECOGNITION OF NEW SYRIAN GOVT India's Stand Praised Continued from Page 8 Column 5 misfortune over Syria Real caution was however necessary about the attitude which India was to take to the new Syrian regime In this matter the hesitation shown by New Delhi in recognising the new Government in Damascus has been commendable particularly even after President Nasser had cleared the way for those who were still in doubt in any case India's recognition will automatically follow Syria's admission into the UN as separate State India however has no intention of being hustled by fear of being forestalled by Pakistan by quirk of fate the Indian Consul-General in Damascus Mr Safrani has found himself in the midst of political turmoil on more than one occasion He was Charged in Baghdad when the Iraqi revolution occurred in July 1958 and his reports about the local situation at that time earned recognition Another Indian diplomat who has found himself in similar situations is Mr Rahman now Charge in Leopoldville During the 1956 revolt in Hungary he was also Charge at Budapest It would therefore be slight exaggeration to say that Indian diplomats are always absent from their post of duty during crisis in the country which they are assigned.
