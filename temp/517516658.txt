Doctors feel heat of riots by JYOTI PUNWANI BOMBAY February 5 THE city which probably has the 1 highest doctor-patient ratio in the country has suddenly turned unlucky for this profession Some of them are seriously considering shifting out Not because their lives were threatened in the recent violence but because their livelihood was and continues to be threatened While life is gradually returning to normal for some Bombayites private medical practitioners feel it will be years before things revert to the pre-January 6 situation for them There are just no patients And as one doctor put it once patients realise they can do without you they will not come back Why have doctors been specially affected Because for most of them work really begins after sunset And these days Bombayites prefer to be home at that time Those doctors who can afford to simply close shop and come home by 730 pm for those who cannot its depressing wait evening after evening This situation prevails whether they practice in areas which witnessed curfew or those that never did Things are worse for those who live far from their clinic such as Dr Jayant consultant at Prarthna Samaj who stays at Khar on Saturday evenings one had to wait for him over an hour despite having an appointment Today hes wondering whether it's worth his while to come all the way to town on that evening Apart from the general fear all over the city certain areas have additional problems Maha-artis create traffic jams and delay people rushing home Says Dr Shah homoeopath who has just begun private practice in Andheri west maha-arti is held practically every evening even rickshaws refuse to ply when maha-arti is on Most of my patients are children and they get scared of crowds At any rate even adults fear to venture out when maha-arti is on Paediatricians especially badly hit Dr Prem who shares his 3 clinic with the homoeopath is home every evening at an hour when he would normally reach his clinic His patients children are at school during the day and even if they are unwell and at home in suburbs like Andheri he points out most couples work and can only 3 bring their children to him after 7 pm 1 The personal relationship plays large part in choosing ones doctor never mind if he or she is far from ones home But today travelling long distances in the evenings is risky because it keeps one out late In addition certain localities have suddenly turned dangerous as Dr Husain Taylor dental surgeon practising in Dongri for the last 21 years has found Patients from Napean Sea Road Opera House Bandra who didnt mind travelling all the way to Samuel Street no longer do so Dr Prems patients now refuse to let their children be admitted to nursing home nearby only because the area in which it is located has Muslim-sounding name gynaecologist at the Mumbadevi Homoeopathic Hospital Juhu where 80 per cent of the patients are Muslim revealed that women who have been coming to deliver their children go home after couple of days instead of staying on for five days as they normally would They dont feel safe because now they see this as Hindu hospital Its outpatient department has more or less stopped functioning she says The same fear works with doctors too Dr SN Dalmia general Continued on Page 30# Doctors feel heat of riots Continued from Page 1# practitioner who lives works in Girgaum says he can no longer drive through Bhendi Bazar to visit his old patients at Byculla 1 used to deliberately go through the bylanes of Bhendi Bazar to avoid the signals now first find out from my patient whether theres enough traffic outside his residence before agreeing to go there and drive only on the main road Dr Guptas pathological laboratory at Andheri has begun to close by 8 pm instead of the earlier closing time of 930 pm Not only do patients prefer to collect their reports the next day rather than the same evening his female staff who live in the nearby suburb of Ville Parle and across the railway bridge in Andheri itself have to reach home early if they are to be allowed to come to work at all Dr Ibrahim's earnings at Dharavi have reduced by half His wife who used to go to their clinic in the mornings has stopped doing so because she#s too scared to walk through the Hindu areas from the station to the clinic Women are worse off be they doctors or patients Dr Gupta has decided that no longer will blood samples be collected from homes of patients. He cannot allow his female staff to venture out of the clinic at all Dr Husain Taylor finds that his female patients even in Dongri are not being allowed out of the house Doctors who practice in large housing colonies are better off but only if the colony houses people from one community alone doctor too belongs to that community Dharavi can be regarded as rather large housing colony but Dr Ibrahim GP finds that few Hindu patients risk coming to him because he is surrounded by Muslims One who did jokingly asked him if he was giving him the right injection Dr Shah the homoeopath finds that his Muslim patients who live in colony just behind his clinic have stopped coming because he practices in purely Hindu colony No Muslim patients says Dr Prem means no money It's only they who pay up promptly howsoever poor they may be large number of these prompt payers have stopped coming simply because they are no longer in town Dr Ibrahim estimates that 30 per cent of his Muslim patients have fled Dharavi Those who stayed behind have no money to spend on doctors Lack of money for medical help unless its emergency has hit both those who depend on working and middle class patients as well as doctors who practice at Kemps Corner Admissions in the Jaslok Hospital OPD reveals one doctor are down by 30 per cent This has never been so bad say doctors Dr Taylor in his 21 years of practice hasnt had his practice reduced by half nor seen the congested Samuel Street near Masjid Bunder so deserted not even in 1984 when Dongri was one of the worst hit areas Dr Dahnia recalls that the January 23-24 weekend was the worst since he began practice 18 years ago didn't even have to touch my injection tray he says in bewilderment Hindu patients are not coming to Hindu doctor in predominantly Hindu area Dr Ibrahim estimates that he earns less now than he did the day he began practising in Dharavi eight years back His normal clinic timings used to be 6 pm to 1230 am now he packs up by 9 pm There's no movement in the area after that According to Dr Ibrahim three things are necessary before the situation to come back normal Those who left Bombay should return They as well as those who remained here should start earning enough to spend on doctors and finally the mutual Trust that existed must come back All this will take at least year he feels however the paediatrician doubts whether life for doctors will ever be the same again Bombay is never going to be safe at night now Theyve tasted blood they wont give up easily Dr Gupta agrees Today you dont need reason to get arrested by the police who will immediately slap TADA on you Why risk being out at night Because of the doctors are considering drastic changes in their practice Dr Ibrahim for instance feels he will have to open clinic elsewhere in the city where his wife can practice in the mornings and he can in the afternoons He cannot afford to sustain his leisurely lifestyle of practicing only in the latter half of the day much longer Dr Prem too is wondering whether to start afternoon practice somewhere else if his Andheri clinic continues to remain deserted in the evenings It is only Dr Taylor who is optimistic that things will return to normal within couple of months Bombayites forget easily They took two-three days to recover from the 1984 riots they'll take two-three months to forget these riots
