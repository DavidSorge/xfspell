but are higher than those of the space It is through the launching of APPLE that India is hoping to acquire capability for injecting the craft into orbit from synchronous transfer orbit and for in-orbit management of the craft and of course for its utilisation The task of taking APPLE from the transfer orbit to the target position will be ISROs For this among other things command from the control centre at Sharp will fire the indigenous apogee boost rocket motor of the satellite APPLE will be tracked by worldwide network comprising ESA earth station at Kourou in French Guyana Carnarvon
