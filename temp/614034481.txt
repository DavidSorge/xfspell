By SUBHASH MORADABAD August 24 FOR town that earns crores of rupees in foreign exchange through the exports of brassware and tobacco to America Europe and West Asia this district town is woefully congested and filthy at the best of times Hundreds of thousands of families who earn their livelihood by making exquisite brassware like vase water jugs table lamps ash trays and other decorative items are feeling the pinch of the curfew imposed on August 13 and which has been relaxed for a few hours for the last five days The exporters are also in quandary They have run up losses running into few crores in the last 10 days In some cases stocks ready for export have been destroyed in the violence and arson that took place in the aftermath of the August 13 tragedy at the Idah Mr Khan partner in the Mohammed Yar Khan Brassware Export Corporation told this reporter that his shop in Bazar Ganj was looted and set on fire on the night of August 17 According to Mr Khan the miscreants entered from side lane climbed the roof and threw fireballs He says that they pushed rifles at the throat of the Chhotey Lai and demanded the keys to the shop Mr Khan is concerned because his letters of credit expire on August 31 He knows that his American and British buyers will not show any sympathy and extend the period This is competitive business he points out Mr Khan who says he belongs to the sixth generation of the family which virtually founded the metalware industry in India way back in 1873 laments that this is the first time in his memory that such grave situation has arisen. causing loss of lives and disruption of business How severe the losses can be assessed from the fact that the railways provide one goods train every day to transport export cargo from Moradabad to various foreign destinations from Bombay or New Delhi An estimate of the value of exports can also be had from Mr Khan who travels abroad frequently and is member of the Moradabad brassware exporters. association All exporters together send out consignments worth Rs 80 crores to Rs 90 crores he says Estimates by Mr CP Govil DIG of police put Moradabad's total exports of brassware and tobacco at Rs 90 crores of which the former accounts for Rs 60 crores and the latter for the remaining Rs 30 crores The biggest exporters of brassware and enamel plate silver nickel include apart from Khan. brassware export corporation Wajid Ali and sons Mohammed Yamin and Haji Fhasan The undisputed tobacco king is said to be Sheikh Shamsuddin Manzur Haque Many of these exporters have palatial with huge lawns As Mr Khan puts it the makers of the brass artware are by and large Muslims all members of families being trained in this craft Usually the art is handed down from one generation to another. Those who finance the manufacture are mainly Hindus The exporters include members of both the communities The craze for brass in America has boosted Moradabad fortunes in an unimaginable way while exports have shot up to that destination the flow of gold from Wall Street to the Gulf countries has generated similar crazes for things Indian Our Arab friends want not only our technicians and builders but also our brass and artware They are very keen to buy vegetables and even meat says Mr Khan who has been on several business trips to the Gulf countries About 15 to 20 per cent of Mora exports to West Asian countries This will grow because the Arabs have all the money and all the power says Mr Khan In the context of this flow of money to Moradabad one would expect it to be neat and tidy town with prosperity writ large on its lace But it all such expectations It is grim looking town more so under curfew when deserted and doors and windows are shut tight Such is the eerie silence that it almost looks like ghost town Once curfew is relaxed the narrow street and winding lanes are full of people hurrying to buy sugar oil foodgrains and other necessities Sugar incidentally is selling for less than Rs seven kg The prolongation of the curfew has been particularly hard on children who must feel suffocated indoors with no chace to play in the evening The only fortunate part is that there are no power breakdowns here But the filth and flies that have accumulated in the lanes and by-lanes are horrid sight More so with stench emanating from animals lying in some areas However the authorities have provided armed guards to safai who are now engaged in the task of cleaning up this town street by street and lane.
