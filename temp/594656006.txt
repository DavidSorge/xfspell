Secunderabad cities led to the suspicion that they are not all unrelated incidents but were the result of conscious attempt to cause rioting and bloodshed For the flame reason the hand of the goonda in the flag-hoisting mischief may be ruled out although it is true that unsocial elements invariably take advantage during such confusion as was evident in Niamabad and later in Gulbarga where loss of property was by loss of life powerful all-India communal or 6 must be behind this because much mischievous Jiave occurred in at least three places in North India As investigations are still in

POLICE WORK PRAISED In the course of the debate In the Assembly on the adjournment motion on the Nazamabad disturbances which was ed by the Speaker he had consulted the Advocate- General Pandit Narendraji Congress rebutting the charge against the police declared that the police had done wonderful work in spite of the fact that it was impossible for few policemen to control mob of 5000 Reprying to the debate the Deputy Home Minister admitted that the Government was in possession of certain information of what was brewing in Nizamabad but nobody he said could anticipate what turn the events would take He also admitted that the police force present at the time of the disturbance was too small to deal with the situation effectively In spite of these handicaps the police had done their best he claimed He remarked that whatever the provocation the Government could not allow the people to take the law into their own hands In fairness to the Government it must be mentioned that on the day following jthe Nizamabad incident it promptly issued an appeal to the public not to take the law into their own hands but report unsocial acts to the authorities to be altered with according to law But the Warning went unheeded and few days later the people at Gulbarga the ancient capital of the Bahmani kings imitated the Nizamabad mobs andtook the law into their own hands with the result that seven persons lost their lives and number were injured It is however gratifying to note that neither the Sharaa Basappa Temple the Lingayet shrine nor the Darga of Bande Nawaz the Muslim shrines were touched PEACE COMMITTEES Peace committees have been formed in Hyderabad and other places where disturbances took place and these are doing excellent work in restoring harmony between the majority and minority communities but leaders of opposition political parties as well as some influential Congress MLAS have expressed the belief that nothing short of an open Inquiry into these reincidents would satisfy the public public opinion finitely in favour of the appointment of commission to inquire into the causes of the recent disturbance in order that persons or organisations responsible for the mischief might be exposed and suitably punished Unless this is done communal harmony cannot be restored So far the Government appears to be fighting shy of toe public demand for gin open inquiry
