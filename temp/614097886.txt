These incidents were part of an attempt to terrorise and weaken not only the minority communities but also the weaker sections so that their attempts to improve 4hdr social and economic conditions could be crippled The virulence of been aggravated by the current political atmosphere in which opportunities to grab power have pushed principled politics into the background The worst aspects of present-day politics is that the worst like the RSS have been given respectability and encouragement by even those people who know its character and have for years been warning the nation against it the resolution added. It urged all secular-minded and democratic parties and individuals to rise above partisan politics and building movement against the communal danger The resolution demanded punishment of officials for dereliction of duty at Aligarh disbandment of the Provincial Armed Constabulary early action against those accused of peratrocities and severance of all links with the RSS by secular-minded politicians Prof Rahmani who was of the Janata party fact-finding mission to Aligarh said the genesis of the trouble lay in the amendment of the Aligarh Muslim University act by the previous Congress government. Without naming the RSS he said that the communal holocaust in the city last month was caused by fascist well-trained para-military organisation Mr Hashmi had no time in naming the RSS as the culprit He said the disturbances could only have been organised by well-trained organisation with resources Otherwise how could violence have flared-up in the city on October 5 when the district authorities had clapped over 200 bad characters in jail Another indication of the well-organised hand behind the riot was the virtual communication breakdown in the city with even the district officials not being able to contact each other on the telephone The telephonic communication was only restored after at the highest level He regretted that certain elements in the government defended the role at the RSS. He said Aligarh was to the country and the regains the RSS should be taken advantage of so that the criminal virus could be exterminated.
