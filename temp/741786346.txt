Meerut riots deal blow to industries By SRIVASTAVA The Times of India News Service MttKUi June THE recent disturbances have dealt blow to the city's traditional industries handloom sports goods and scissors making from which they will take long while to recover the production loss alone is estimated at above Rs 30 crores The loss of assets is yet to be compiled but will be substantial Nearly three lakh people Hindus and Muslims in equal numbers were dependent on these industries But the loss of the Hindus has been greater for the simple reason that by and large they were the owners traders But the Muslim powerloom owners have also suffered greatly Most of the losses were caused by the violence between the evenings of May 1 8 and May 20. Even the timing of the disturbances was inopportune because June to October is the busiest period for the textile industry HANDLOOM INDUSTRY The handloom industry 1986 turnover approximately Rs 600 crores has suffered the most Meerut has nearly 500 handloom units including 50 factories for printing and dyeing Each of these factories employs roughly 50 people mostly Muslims As many as 1 5 of these factories located along the Muslim- dominated Pilokhadi road have been destroyed Meerut has seen several riots but this has never happened before Meeruts 40000-odd powerloom units mostly owned by the Muslims have also fallen silent are likely to remain silent for some time because scores of shops and godowns of traders who used to supply yarn to weavers were looted and set ablaze Each of the nearly 100 traders in Hindus generally kept stocks worth Rs 10 lakhs each to supply to weavers few traders specializing in design printing and dyeing exclusively produce handloom cloth worth Rs 15 crores annually for export With the destruction of dozen factories specialising in the production of printed handloom cloth designs much in demand in the national and international markets will be difficult to get Ninety per cent of the 40000 powerloom owners are Muslims Each powerloom unit requires the services of three labourers at least more than 20000 labourers from far off eastern Uttar Pradesh Bihar and even Nepal earn their living from these powerlooms Since the powerlooms are now silent the migrant labour has left the city in search of work elsewhere This explains the current exodus of population from the riot-ravaged city which is being misinterpreted by many as fear-induced one The powerlooms output mostly bedsheets khadi and rough cloth is sold to Hindu traders who market it nation-wide Expectedly their margin is higher than the powerloom owners constant source of friction between the two communities This explains the communal nature of the damage SPORTS GOODS The sports goods industry 1986 turnover Rs 25 crores approximately provides living to about 130,000 people There are nearly 700 sports goods units in Meerut including 25 units engaged exclusively in the production and export of cricket equipment and carrot boards Last year Meerut exported nearly Rs 8 crores worth of sports goods The sports goods industry is spread in an area of about 20km with its centre at Surajkund There are few factories -since most of the work is done on piece-meal basis at home So while there has not been too much of capital loss the output has suffered because the disturbances enveloped the areas of Garh road Lisadi gate Tarapuri and Abdullahpur where most of the workers live Meerut sports goods have so far been faring well in competition against Pakistan Taiwan and China But the fear now is that the goods produced here will find it hard to compete because many skilled workers in both communities have been affected The scissors industry provides sustenance to nearly 40000 people The manufacturer of scissors has five stages and the final stage of chromium plating is done primarily in the Kaichian and Paidamal localities of Meerut Muslims control this industry They have been hit hard because most of the pockets where the work is done was affected by the trouble Still economic times are so compelling that they cannot but be re-forged But what will be difficult to restore trust The loss of that may well be the Innest lasting
