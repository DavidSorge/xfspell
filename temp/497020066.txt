This is causing us great concern not only because of the tremendous burdens thrown on us in the reception and rehabilitation of the thousands who are coming to India but because it presents tragic. human problem knows that these movements of refugees across the border are causing concern both to the Government of East Pakistan and to your Government PEACEFUL SOLUTION There are many problems between our two countries It is our wish to resolve them peacefully and in spirit of co-operation and understanding feel however that the problem presented by the recent movements of the refugees is of the highest importance and priority which if not resolved will further embitter our relations and add to the unhappiness of our peoples We have asked our High Commissioner to present to you. memorandum containing certain proposals of the Government of India for minister-level meeting will be glad if you can receive him personally and give earnest consideration to the proposals contained. in the memorandum which our High Commissioner has been asked to clarify and rate if necessary With kind regards Yours sincerely Jawabarlal Nehru The memorandum attached to this letter said The recent communal disturbances have resulted in mass exodus of minorities from East Pakistan into India Over 3000 destitute refugees are coming into India every day Already over 125,000 refugees belonging to the minority communities have come into India and many more thousands are expected to come in the near future STRAINED RELATIONS Already the resources of the Government of India are taxed to utmost and the prospect of being swamped by such large number of refugees from East Pakistan is one which apart from the enormous burden of relief and rehabilitation of these vast numbers Government of India must shoulder bound to have and is having serious repercussions on the already strained relations between India and Pakistan since the persons coming into India as refugees are Pakistani nationals ill is evident that whatever the causes they are doing so because of any sense of insecurity in East Pakistan The problem has assumed magnitude and character which deeply involves future relations between India and Pakistan and is making future settlement of outstanding differences between the two countries more difficult There were following the disturbances some movement of member of the minority community from Wesi Bengal into East Pakistan in January This movement ended within few days due to the prompt measures taken for the restoration of law and order establishment of full sense of confidence for the security of the minorities in West Bengal It is necessary that earnest efforts should be made to prevent the situation from assuming more dangerous. proportions to tackle urgently the political and economic problems created by this intensely human problem It is in the interests of India and Pakistan to co-operate with each other in solving this serious problem That there is mutuality of interest between India and Pakistan in this matter is obvious This has been rein the past when it is similar though somewhat less serious situation the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan met and concluded the Nehru-Liaquat Agreement on April 8 1950. In that agreement the two Governments committed themselves to admirable principles in regard to the Treatment of minorities in their respective countries To quote from the agreement The Governments of India and Pakistan solemnly agree that each shall ensure to the minorities throughout its territory complete equality of citizenship irrespective of religion full sense of security in respect of life culture property and personal honour freedom of movement within each country and freedom of occupation speech and worship subject to law and morality Members of the minorities shall have equal opportunity with members of the majority community to participate in the public life of their country to hold political or other office and to serve in their country's civil and armed forces Both Governments declare these rights to be fundamental and undertake to enforce them effectively Then followed an agreement on number of points relating to the treatment of and facilities available to the migrants going from one country to the other The agreement was subsequently ratified by both Governments On January 16 1964 the Government of India made proposal to the Government of Pakistan for meeting of the Home Ministers This proposal was conveyed orally by its Indian High Commissioner in karachi when delivering the Indian Presidents message in reply to the Pakistani Presidents message of January 13 In its oral reply dated January 24, 1964 the Government of Pakistan did not consider such meeting necessary It however said that once law and order had been fully restored the Ministers of the two Governments might meet initially in Rawalpindi Delhi to discuss measures necessary ensure that refugees of recent disturbances as also those evicted from Assam Tripura and West Bengal should be enabled to return to their homes In its reply dated January 30, 1964 the Government of India pointed out that it had already agreed to official level talks between the two Governments to be followed by Ministerlevel meeting on the question of the infiltrators into Assam and Tripura from East Pakistan TENSE ATMOSPHERE These discussions did not take place as the atmosphere of tension created in the last few months was not conducive to calm consideration of this issue The Government of India reiterated its willingness to begin talks on this problem as soon as the minister-level meeting it had proposed for restoring communal harmony had been convened and had made progress it further suggested that the Ministers themselves could discuss the timing and modalities of the talks between the two Governments on the movement of persons across the eastern borders The Government of India. is convinced that the present situation makes it imperative that representatives of the Governments of India and Pakistan should confer together in the spirit of the declaration and agreement made by the two Prime Ministers on April 8 1950 and devise ways and means for dealing with the most urgent and indeed the most vital question of restoring complete harmony among the different communities of their citizens and restoring full confidence as regards their security and welfare in their homelands This is necessary not only in the interests of the human problems created by panicky migration across the border but also in the interests of good relations between India and Pakistan No time should therefore be lost in tackling this urgent and vital problem It therefore proposes again that Home Ministers of the Governments of India and Pakistan assisted by their advisers meet immediately as did the Prime Ministers in 1950 to consider the question every aspect of the problem of minorities and movements of refugees both ways can be discussed with view to reaching mutually satisfactory arrangements 1 Equal treatment and the fullest guard protection of the rights of the minorities is the fundamental principle of Indian Constitution This principle is one which has governed and will continue to govern the policies and actions of the Government of India The President of Pakistan in the course of his broadcast from Radio Pakistan on March 1, 1964 also said We regard the minority communities as sacred trust entitled to equal rights and privileges Any One who has been disturbed is welcome to return where one belongs and in this one will have all the support and assistance from us We expect the same from India COMMON GROUND In view of this common ground intentions and objectives the Government of India trust that the Pakistan1 Government will promptly respond to the proposal of the Government of India The Home Minister of the Government of India ready and willing to meet the Home Minister of Pakistan at any time and place of the latters choosing and as soon as possible President Ayub letter dated March 23 said Dear Mr Prime Minister thank you for your letter dated March 19 1964 which your High Commissioner handed over to me on March 20 have read your letter and the enclosed memorandum with care am glad that the Government of India has found it possible to accept the suggestion we made on January 24 namely that once law and order have been fully restored Ministers of the two Governments should meet to discuss measures necessary to ensure that refugees from the recent communal disturbances as also those evicted from Assam and Tripura prior to those disturbances return to their original homes On the other hand regret to note that while you express concern about the refugees from East Pakistan you have expressed no concern or even word of sympathy for the thousands of Indian Muslims who have suffered in the recent riots in India and have fled in panic to East Pakistan and those who have been forcibly evicted from their homes in Assam and Tripura Only a few days before you wrote an entirely unprovoked and obviously pre- planned attack on Muslims in Calcutta resulted According to official Indian press reports riots have taken place in places as far apart as Jamshedpur 55 persons killed Rourkela 53 persons killed March 21# where according to PTI report the situation was described as critical Jharpada Raigarh nine persons killed Kharsia Jamgaon Jharsuguda and Sambalpur doubt whether the figures were published by the Indian press portray anything like the actual loss of innocent lives or the suffering of the Muslim community in the affected areas INHRKNT DANGERS cannot help feeling that if the suggestion of my Government of January 24 for meeting which you have now accepted had been accepted earlier perhaps this latest series of communal disturbances might have been averted However it is not my purpose to start controversy on this subject The important thing is that the Government of India recognises as we do the dangers inherent in the present situation and is aware of the urgent need to re-establish conditions which would enable the uprooted members of the minority community to live in their original homes with full sense of security 1 therefore agree that Ministers of the two. Governments meet at an early date to discuss the measures necessary for this purpose We would be agreeable also to the meeting being held in Delhi Further details in connection with the proposed. meeting will be settled in consultation with your High Commissioner in Karachi Yours sincerely Mohammad Ayub Khan Field Marshal -PT1
