The Riots In Hyderabad ISome Peculiar Features By 1 It was sunny warm afternoon after of rain There was an air of festivity even revelry Women flocked with decorated earthen and brass pots on their heads containing puja offerings along with gaily-dressed children The men were boisterous Some lashed themselves with whips to acquire merit by self-mortification There was singing dancing and drum- beating Two such processions merged into one and began to march through the main gate of the Golconda for the only route available to the temple of Amma Durga and Kali elsewhere few kilometres away The narrow street across which queens and princesses once lived with their retainers was also dotted by mosques The processionists went past some five mosques At the sixth mosque someone objected to. the noise and ordered that the music be stopped An argument ensued In the confusion young man was stabbed to death and another bleeding profusely was carried away He later died in hospital TWO VERSIONS No one can say who started the violence According to some persons the processionists were attacked first and had to defend themselves Others argue that simple request was made to them. processor to play music while prayers were going on in the mosque In any case violence had erupted for the first time in the Golconda area in southern Hydeduring the Bonala annual festival to propitiate the rain god despite the presence of bath of 30 armed policemen to cover some 500 men women and children in the procession The madness spread that night and during the following week from Golconda the 16th century rocky fort around which present-day Hyderabad is built to newer parts of the sprawling metal and also such far-flung areas as Tappa Chabutra Fateh Darwaja Lai Darwaja Afzalgu Tilak Road Mogulpura Chanchalguda and even some streets of the neat and clean twin city of Secunderabad There may be methods in this madness but any impression that it has led to large-scale violence looting and arson as in the case of communal riots elsewhere or in Hyderabad itself in 1979 would be far-fetched Yet the case did have few peculiar features For instance there were few group clashes following the Golconda incident Nor did any fighting erupt on the main roads Even now the pattern is the same miscreant emerges from an alley whips out knife and stabs anyone he can lay his hands on. and vanishes In some cases the aggressor and his victim belong to the same community perhaps thus settling an old score In other villagers who come to town to sell vegetables and milk or make purchases are pounced upon and knifed Sneaky stabbing says local newspaper Fear stalks many sectors of Hyderabad The main task of the chief minister Mr Anjiah who adopts many unconventional methods such as touring the affected areas at odd hours occasionally without police escort is to allay it One of the most easily accessible chief ministers he receives visitors who come in their hundreds but avoids known communal leaders because as he told this correspondent they want to take advantage of the situation for their selfish ends He has temperature but his working time extends to 18 or 20. hours day concerned aide frees him from his visitors and forces him into his anti-chamber to have lunch The time is 7 pm At the height of the tension nearly third of Hyderabad accounting for eight lakhs of people out of total population of 28 lakhs was under curfew It was lifted and reimposed in some areas while in others it was continuously in force for 75 hours the longest they had ever experienced Coupled with increased police patrolling and presence of the Central Reserve Police the curfew has brought down the number of attempted stabbings from about 60 to three per day. Some 25 persons have died in seven days at least two in police firings About two hundred persons have been injured Unofficial sources say that the casualty figures have been suppressed by the government In the Osmania hospital there are at least 32 beds which carry MLC tags Not to be mistaken for members of the legislative council these are medicolegal cases On the beds are Bashir Ahmeds and Eswar Rads as Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee BJP president found during his visit to the hospital Carpetty shopkeepers rickshaw-pullers and people belonging to the low income bracket predominate among them RUMOURS Though over 1200 persons have been arrested including three legislators belonging to the Mujlis Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and some local BJP leaders everyone is keeping his fingers crossed until the end of Bonala festival and Ramzan which is likely to conclude with the customary big gathering at Channinar on August 3 Plenty of rumours are floating around and the people are truly scared For instance body was handed over to relatives after post-mortem examination with the opening made in the skull for the purpose stitched up The marks of the post-mortem examination set tongues wagging gory account of the death appeared in newspaper The man had not only been stabbed to death but nail had been hammered into his head it was said In another case the driver of lorry laden with hay felt that the ropes over the hay stacks were loose He got down from his seat and climbed the rear of the vehicle and lit beedi setting the haystacks ablaze He jumped down and bystanders helped in putting out the fire Rumour however spread that arsonists had claimed another victim belonging to particular community Some newspapers in fact add fuel to the flr by mentioning the names of the dead and injured displaying their reports provocatively For all that ordinary Hyderabadis still retain their old-world charm courtly manners and courtly go out of their way to give the visitor tips on how tfl keep out of trouble If you happen to come across tough-looking person dont try to pick up conversation wizened Muslim bearer told me and if you do then dont disclose your name for this would help identify the community you belong to strangers in striped pyjamas and Bruce Lee shirt with the name of the karate hero inscribed boldly on it did accost me in Sultan Shahi and tried to talk What is your name he asked abruptly But had been tutored My name is Percy DSouza said He showed he further interest in me and went off looking for whatever target he had in mind BACKGROUND Then again ask any Hyderabadi the genesis of the trouble that started on that fateful day May 12 and regardless of the community to which he belongs he will offer you seat cup of tea and insist on your knowing the background History is recalled In the olden days the Nizam held the scales more or less even between the two major communities. He even used to gift annually necklace of pearls to temple on the occasion of Ram Navami It was only towards the end of the British rule that he lost his grip The Mujlis spawned Razakaars under Kasim Razvi and raised the cry of independence for Hyderabad or its merger the Pakistan After the Hyderabad action the Mujlis changed course In 1969 it won few assembly seats and gained political resin the eves of almost all the successive chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh. supported the Telangana separatist movement The patronage it received from the ruling circles put it in an advantageous position making others suspicious of its motives and intentions Relations between the two communities in the Muslim-dominated old city bylanes and sequestered paths and Hindu-preponderant newer parts broad roads and modern buildings are however still close and amicable They get on very well with each other in trade and commerce in the province in the working class movement On the steps of temple which Mr Vajpayee BJP leader visited after learning that its idols had been trampled upon by police constable were sarically Hindu women and Muslim women in salwar-kurta with no sign of bitterness towards one another To be concluded
