Myth about Surat shattered 1 lie rimes of India News Sen Ice SlRAI December 13 THImyth has been shattered and shattered it has been violently Surat the symbol of communal harmony through the centuries and the island of unflinching Hindu-Muslim unity through thick and thin in communally sensitive Gujarat today stands ghost of its former self Terrorism shrouded in conv has left behind deer scars will take years to heal not to speak of the over 175 live lost and the loss to property trade and industry which may well be up to over Rs 100 The chain of events in the last few days which shook the very roots and foundations of Surat and the magnitude of these events were frankly speaking not predicted either by the police intelligence department or for that matter by the political leaders Even the minister Mr Chimanbhai Patel who told Surat on Wednesday accepted that the unfortunate developments were totally unexpected The question that still remains to be answered is whether the riots were spontaneous or pre-planned Nobody has the answer right now and only full-fledged inquiry by Mr Bhargava 1GP Intelligence may provide some answer Primarily it was systems failure on all the fronts as the city known for its mercantile nature throughout the country did not even know that of communal riots The Surat police force which is not only understaffed over burdened and ill-equipped totally not only in handling the situation as it had no prior experience in tackling communal dis but also in its forecast The present police strength in the city stands roughly at what it was 22 years ago in 1970 while the city has developed in leaps and bounds on all the fronts including population Development is very misleading word for Surat for the development has not added any muscles to the city but has made it obscene with lot of fat While this development was rapid and unplanned the state home department failed to match this pace by not sanctioning adequate staff and police stations resulted in what the former police commissioner Mr Dutta rightly described as naked areas as far as the police force is concerned One may be surprised to learn that the present police force in Surat and that the reinforced police force is equivalent to the police strength Baroda has during peace times and interestingly the population of Surat is nearly double than that of Baroda So what happened in the first two days of rioting was that just no men were available to rush to trouble spots as hundreds of frantic calls were made at the police conand if the police at all managed to reach the spot it was after the act was over and done with When riots broke out in Salabatpura one of the first areas to be engulfed in communal frenzy the police inspector of Varachha Road was directed to move over to Salabatpura police station Once again there was no anticipation that Varachha would become one of the worst-hit areas Two other factors which may also be taken into consideration disturbing of the equilibrium and the bruised ego of the policemen So far in Surat sort of equilibrium had prevailed between different segments of society including the underworld The attitude was gentlemen you do your duty let me do my work This equilibrium functioned in smooth harmony with the easygoing life-style of Surat What happened was the Dutta factor disturbed this equilibrium in the last one and half months The former police commissioner was man in hurry to stem the rot and immediately on resuming the charge he started taking action left right and centre again the ego was bruised because the former commissioner started giving dressingdowns to senior officials right in front of their juniors whereas in sharp contrast the Surat police force had its own style of functioning in the final run it is the chief who gets the brickbats or the board so it was Mr Dutta who had to take the bow from Surat Whatever has been done now cannot be undone and as it is rightly said throughout The world time is the best healer but the need of the hour as an army general told the new police commissioner Mr Bansal was confidence-building
