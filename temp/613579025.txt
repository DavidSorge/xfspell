Stuntmanship Leads To Disaster Politics has become akin to speculation Fortunes in this even otherwise precarious profession have come to change with rapidity which is breath-taking The Gujarat chief. Minister Mr Madhavsinh Solankis is case in point In the first week of March he led the Congress to spectacular victory at the polls Within days he was confronted with struggle of perhaps unprecedented intensity even for Gujarat And like speculators he has himself largely to blame He engaged in unnecessary recklessness in disregard of his own and his predecessor's experience He trifled with the people of Gujarat Our writer describes how by Special Correspondent THE bloody events in Ahmedabad and other parts of Gujarat that have sent shock waves through the country for days together fit in. with disturbing pattern of political brinkmanship of the worst type often seen in free VllVlJ 1U HVC India in which the police have been willing to partner For all the excesses committed in the name of law and order in the walled city of Ahmedabad founded in 1411 by Ahmed Shah the police force was hand-in-glove with some ruling political bosses The idea initially was to use the lathi to break the back of the anti-reservation stir Looking back this was the second major political blunder on the part of Chief Minister Madhavsinh Solanki the first being the pre-assembly poll announcement that hiked the total reservation quota in medical and technical institutions from 31 to 49 per cent this move was prompted by certain crude caste arithmetic When the students protested and the chief minister found the going though he just became silent spectator to the sordid goings-on instead of trying to find political answers to the problem thin wall of false prestige stood between him and the agitation leaders Some visible and invisible Congress1 dissidents only made matters worse for him Of course Mr Solanki was quick to blame the opposition and the press for his troubles standard practice with all politicians when they are unable to control difficult situation The chief minister even went to the extent of suggesting that if newspapers blacked out reporting the events normalcy would be restored within week Was it an indirect tribute to the power of the Press Or did Mr Solanki mean to say that the troubles were engineered by the Ahmedabad newspapers Whatever Might be his real intent the police apparently took the cue and made Gujarat Samachar Indian Express The Times of India and couple of fearless reporters the target of their wrath True the tragic killing of the head constable in Ahmedabad on Monday was shameful and condemnable act but it must be acknowledged that the police repression in the walled city had generated a wave of resentment And when newspapers faithfully reported incidents of excesses in detail the police resented this week before the attack on some newspaper establishments senior police officer bad warned this correspondent that we would not take press criticism lying down Wait and watch the consequences This did not turn out to be an empty threat as events unfolding themselves from Monday onwards proved It is clear that police would not have acted the way it did had there been no tacit understanding with section of ruling politicians Even if for the 6ake of argument we concede this to be a freak case not prompted or inspired by small-time politicians it will again be considered as the failure of the state admits to contain the police force when it crossed all civilized norms There was apparently method in this police madness It may not be proper to incidentify these small-time politicians who led the police on path of confrontation with their own people Probably they themselves never realised that their petty promptings could lead to such tragic consequences It is indeed sad to 6ee Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel fast losing relevance in the state of their birth The voices of sanity are apparently lost in crescendo of mob fury police violence intolerance and hatred In place of the Mahatma and Patel Gujarat today has growing rank of politicians who are an antithesis of all that the two great sons of the soil our national idols have stood for Many veteran Gandhians this correspondent met at the height of the crisis could only shed few crocodile tears at the current drift They protested but too mildly and that too privately No politician of standing reacted in the manner in which the Mahatma used to do to shake the conscience of the nation But it must be said to the credit of the people of Gujarat that they have resisted and reacted sharply to the atrocities of the policemen For days together the middle-class dominated Khedia area in the walled city was the scene of pitched battles. between the trigger-happy cops and the people This was surely not happy situation for democratic policy such as ours but the violence and counter-violence was inevitable in the fast changing events in Ahmedabad Rightly or wrongly Mr Masolanki's government right from the beginning viewed the anti-reservation stir as political challenge to itself after all the chief minister had been prompted purely by political considerations to raise the reservation quota Fhere was no need for such measure for the simple reason that even the current served seats for Scheduled Caste Scheduled Tribe and Backward class students remain unutilised Mr Solanki is apparently an ambitious person who like many other fellow politicians believes that more power flows out of more Mr Solanki's action is all the more regrettable since he bad to face similar wrath from the student community in 1981 and had to climb down and buy peace with the agitating students But then Indian politicians are not known for learning from their past follies and Mr Solanki is no exception Broadly speaking Mr Solanki is sharp person but he had never believed in taking his heavyweight colleagues along with him He first fell out with Ratubhai Adani the veteran Saurashtra leader Later he was at daggers drawn with Mr Jinabhai Darji the person who worked out the KHAM Kshatriya Harijan Adi vasi Muslim strategy that paved the way for spectacular Congress-1 victory in 1980 Later be was at war with some of his senior cabinet colleagues like Mr Santa Mehta and Mr Jadeja He dropped many heavyweight politicians in the last poll including some of those close to him Mr Prabody Raval and Mrs Kokilabehn Vyas This was seen as balancing act With so many veterans left out his cabinet looked mediocre for all practical purposes And it must be said Home Minister Amarsinh Chowdhry nay the entire government machinery failed to meet the political challenge that the anti-reservation agitation threw up It wont be an exaggeration to say that in sheer desperation the government leaders sought to tackle political challenge through repressive police measures this was yet another political blunder on the part of the chief minister Police excesses are to be seen to be believed The police behaved as if they are in an alien land Several acts of removal of water taps tampering with the main water pipelines ransacking of houses roughing-up women were carried out systematically What are more attempts were made to give communal and casteist slant to several isolated events For that matter even bootleggers contributed to series of bizarre developments that unfolded themselves while the political leadership stood dazed and confused It did not know how to respond gracefully and without loss of face Resentment No Guilt situation meanwhile went from bad to worse What is desis that there was no sense of guilt as some newspapers exposed the sordid tales of police excesses If anything the police resented such exposures No wonder it singled the press and newsmen out as the targets of their wrath The April 22 haps should be grim reminder to all democracy-watchers of how vulnerable the Fourth Estate is Orwellian shades indeed Who authorised the police to take the law in their bands fhis brings us to some sad facts of the bizarre happenings in Gujarat -First more than the opposition groups it is the dissident Congress-l men who aided and abetted the forces of disorder in the state Of course it is the job of the opposition parties to exploit situation that is politically inconvenient to the ruling party but violence was inducted by the police with indirect and invisible official blessings with an eye on breaking the agitation. Second, the government machinery was found totally inadequate to meet the changing situation It was either callous or too slow to react Third the police was either slack or too over-reaching Continued on Page IV Leads to disaster Continued from Page 1 Fourth it must be said that the anti-reservation stir was not a political show in the beginning It was only mild show of protest first organised in the Sautown of Morvi But slowly and surely it acquired wider base with various political groups jumping onto the bandwagon Mr Shankerbhai Patch who is spearheading the movement this time does not belong to any political group But he seems to determined person whose re is against those politicians who have made the reservation plank matter of political expediency Where do we go from here In the first place violence whether by police or other segments of society has to be curbed with an iron hand Unfortunately this task will have to be performed by the army now The public has lost faith in the police True Ahmedabad has witnessed revolt by the police even in the past But the systematic violence and reign of terror let loose by the police this time have crossed all decent limits. It will take quite some time before public confidence in the police is restored lot will depend on whether the state government punishes the guilty and revamps the force But then the Solanki government itself has lost all moral authority to rule the state Some of his utterances responses have had casteist overtones What one fears in these circumstances is possible backlash from pro-reservation forces Even Mr Jinabhai Darzi is capable of mobilizing tribals just to embarrass Mr Solanki That will be sad Gujarat for that matter the whole of the country cannot be allowed to become an arena for class or caste war Probably what Gujarat needs is Gandhi to give it healing touch. and revive the peoples faith in moral theory and moral values For the present all that is promised is second Navnirman But the moot point is Did the first Navnirman solve any problem except to topple corrupt ministry led by Mr Chimanbhai Patel One set of corrupt rulers has been replaced by another set of corrupt and arrogant rulers So the system remains as hollow and vulnerable as ever Ironically Mr Chimanbhai Patel too is very much around to give helping hand to the very forces which once toppled him He is today the leader of the opposition in the assembly He is probably seeking poetic. justice for himself So far so good But the moot point again is Who could be JP to provide seal of legitimacy to the current stir Actually the present agitation has lost its bite since Mr Solanki has accepted most demands of the stir leaders But unfortunately the reservation issue has now become political Be that as it may the wounds of violence are too raw for anyone to prompt an objective. reflection on the real state of affairs Ahmedabad has only succeeded in sending shock waves through the nation But going by past experiences mere shock waves however desirable do not necessarily prompt positive line of action All that has been done is to add yet another problem to the national list of unsolved explosive problems.
