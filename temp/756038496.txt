Gujarat sitting on powder keg Bv ASHRAF SAYED The Times of India News Service AHMEDABAD September 6 seems to be sitting powder keg and the slightest spark can ignite major -nn The riots in Baroda Anand AnkJeshwar and Bardoli on the day of Ganesh idol immersion provides yet another reminder that the communal forces are ever ready to take liberties with the law and order situation The only painful as well as horrifying inference one can draw if the police force is not only politicised but has also become highly complicated. The rampant groupism among senior police officers has neither t nor the civic administration In Baroda not only did the police passively watch the riots but it also aided and abetted the criminal activities of the anti-social elements For an hour the police could not find the courage or the inclination to act decisively Thus anti-social elements ended up looting and burning nearly 100 shops and Kiosks Pvpn and reticent chief minister Mr Chimanbhai Patel had to admit that the police commissioner of Baroda had erred assessing the situation and not taking the necessary action According to Mr Patch the government had received prior intelligence reports about of communal trouble in Baroda Surat and other places and senior police officers including the commissioner of Baroda were alerted 24 hours in advance It is baffling why the police failed to take any precautionary measures to deal with the situation According to reports only handful of policemen armed with lathis were accompanying procession of an estimated strength of nearly one lakh It is also alleged that some processionists were drunk and were carrying liquor bottles The speed with which hooligans caused widespread havoc was also surprising because within one hour not only six people were killed but also more than 80 received injuries and shops on the entire route of the procession were either burnt or looted Many are also surprised about the timing of the riots which broke out simultaneously in Anand Ankleshwar and Bardoli Some believe that it was strategy to destabilise the chief minister who is emerging stronger with each passing day soon after Mr Patel assumed office in Gandhinagar chain of riots broke out in various towns This was considered as an attempt to malign the chief minister It is a well-known fact that Mr Patel has been walking on tight-rope from the day he took over His options are limited and he would act only if it was question of his political survival Thus it is anybody's guess as to how firm the police would be in Baroda and other riottorn towns Moreover the police force is divided into groups and sub-groups having loyalty to one or the other senior officers Another factor that has demoralised the police force is political interference Likes and dislikes have come to play crucial role in appointments rather than the ability of particular officers to handle situation Many senior officers have virtually no say in running the department with diktat coming from
