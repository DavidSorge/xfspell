Riots in metropolis on unprecedented scale By BOMBAY December 10 THE 1984 communal riots started in Bhiwandi on May 17 and then spread to Thane and Bombay But they were nowhere on the scale witnessed. in Bombay this time That is clear from the toll which was 87 for population of 86 million then This stood out even in contrast to the toll in Thane town which was 59 for population of 600,000 then The in 1984 started on the night of May 1819 when members of the Muslim community came out on the streets at about dozen places simultaneously from 930 pm to 1130 pm in what appeared to be show of force police officer and two constables were killed that night The following day three more policemen were injured when they were fired on at Musafirkhana The police then under the command of the high-profile commissioner Mr JF Ribeiro cracked down heavily and nipped further trouble in south Bombay But the trouble thereafter spread to the suburbs mostly in the sprawling hutment colonies of Kherwadi in Bandra east Main Jogeshwari Bhatwadi Barvenagar and Nityanand Nagar in Ghatkopar Tembipada in Bhandup and parts of Mulund bordering the troubled Wagle Estate in Thane Ultimately the army. was inducted into these places Unlike the city police army jawans being physically fit literally chased trouble-makers over long distances through the by-lanes and swamps of the sprawling shanti towns and rounded them up with minimum firing The jawans also effectively cordoned off whose areas in the slums while the city police searched and seized weapons marked features of the 1984 riots was that normal life was not disrupted during the day though sneak attacks and stabbings spread fear and panic causing the outward calm to look deceptive This made it more difficult for the police to respond effectively unlike in the case of mob attack At no time was traffic on the main arterial roads dislocated or the movement of trains taxis buses and other vehicles halted as happened this time. There was no marked absenteeism in factories and offices though shops closed by turns in different parts because of rumours or bandh calls given by the Shiv Sena In contrast to the 1969 Shiv Sena riots of the 1982 disturbances when the police rebelled following the attempt to disband their union there was no large-scale looting arson on mass violence in 1984
