But want to assure the members that the situation has been absolutely normal since arrests had been made on the basis of the first information report police camp had been set up there Mr Basu giving the details of the two clashes concluded that the clashes had taken place because of the determined attitude of the local Janata supporters despite the parry's support to the bandh call and Congress abetment It was not correct as Mr Ojha had made out in his statement that normal life in the age was disrupted and school children did not boycott classes in protest Shops were open and functioning Both the incidents as the chief minister explained involved the issue of closing down schools When the authorities of primary school closed it down Janata supporters and others opposed the decision and there was clash with participants in CPM-Ied procession Seven houses were damaged and five injured During the other clash two injured students were sent to hospital In this case the head master declared the school closed and those who resented this started throwing stones and they injured some bandh supporters WRONG INFORMATION As soon as Mr Basu had finished Mr Ojha protested that the chief minister had been given wrong information Janata never opposed the bandh and was necessary for about 1000 men to muster in the Lalua village area only to dose down eight or ten schools he asked few minutes later Mr Ojha again sought to draw the chair's attention waving sheaf of papers But Mr Habibullah would not allow him to make another speech saying am satisfied about your personal safety find you can come and attend the house The Islamic issue on the other hand was brought up more than once by Congress members during the zero hour with seemingly indifferent impact Mr Satya Bapuli Congress-I said ever since the September 11 law and order incidents had been taking place every day pointing to serious deterioration of the situation whatever the chief minister stated in the house in this regard was either distorted or on the basis of what the police said We want judicial inquiry or committee of the house going into the incident he added But what Mr Sajjad Hossain Congress said about the Islampur incident after visit to the area more or less supported the official version available so far. He even explained how the police had promptly intervened surrounding the hostile crowd of attackers fired on them and arrested over 200 In his view it was not communal impact but who actually provoked the clash that needed to be investigated
