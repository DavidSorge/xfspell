Political Commentary Cynicism About Communalism By INDER MALHOTRA ET is first of all discard fatuous Leuphemisms Clever and chronically accepted phrases such as clashes between rival groups belonging to two different communities hide nothing and do not delude anyone Nor do they diminish the inevitable fall-out of nf inn cent people being killed in cold blood and their homes and places of worship burnt or attacked So if Hindu-Muslim riots take place as they have indeed been taking place with heart-rending frequency and viciousness they must be squarely faced as such. Those of us old enough to do so much remember the general belief in the pre-independence era that communal killings and communalism were the bitter fruits of the seeds of divide and rule shown by British imperialism and that with the advent of independence this scourge would become thing of the past No matter how naive the conviction as well as the fond hope might have been they were sincere Now 42 years on we know better Wanton Killings There has been no let-up in HinduMuslim tensions often leading to mad frenzy and wanton killings but that is not the only carnage the country is beset with Violent conflict between various Hindu castes especially the atrocities by the so-called upper castes on Harijans and Adivasis can be no less virulent. Even within the Muslim minority Shias and Sunnis are often at each others throats And the angry reof the anti-Sikh riots in the wake of Mrs Indira Gandhi's assassination have yet to subside However it is only fair to recognise that while conflicts and even carnages in the country tend to be multi-faceted and multi-layered those between Hindus and Muslims because of their historical roots geographical spread and emotional intensity are the most dangerous and damaging national unity They therefore have to be taken most seriously for their own sake never mind the international complications some are only too happy to create But precisely the reverse seems to be The pattern of the present rash of riots is particularly sinister These have spread from Rajasthan to Gujarat in the west Madhya Pradesh in the south UP in the east and now further eastwards to Bihar where they have assumed very alarming proportions and spread for the first time to hopelessly underpoliced villages and yet rather than do anything to combat and control the proliferating madness the two sides across the political divide have been busy denouncing each other in the most intemperate terms for having engineered the large-scale killings and arson Mr Singh has accused the Congress of having prepared diabolical plan to promote communal strife to improve its electoral prospects Mr Rajiv Gandhi who flew to Bhagalpur the scene of the worst tragedy so far is returning compliment to his opponents particularly the BJP The whole scene is rather like home being on fire and the family instead of fighting the flames squabbling about who started the conflagration in the first place That the approaching elections have something to do with the sudden spurt in the incidents which have then led to unrestrained and often systematic killings is clear even to the meanest. intelligence But the question is whether the elections by themselves could have wrought the present havoc had the ground for it not been prepared in advance Also could the level of brutality witnessed in recent weeks be reached without premeditation and prior planning Answers to both questions must be firmly in the negative Not to beat about the bush the fact must be faced with raw communal passions have been roused cynically and blatantly by both sides especially over the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute It was nearly five years ago that he gates of the shrine locked since 1949 opened under the orders of subordinate court and the resultant jubilation among Hindus widely publicised over the TV screen The Muslim reaction was swift and sharp The Babri Masjid action committee. was formed and -issued dire threats to seek the restoration of status quo ante at the disputed spot Rival rhetoric became increasingly inflammatory For most of this time Mr Arun Nehru now pillars of the Janata Dal was the second most powerful man in the Central government As virtual head of the Union home ministry he was also the final arbiter of the goings-on at Ayodhya Divisive Message critical question is why the sensible formula of taking the issue to the higher court devised much too late was not thought of at an earlier stage For though the high court is seized of the matter both sides have given assurances of sorts to accept the verdict the situation on the ground has already become far too dangerous The imponderables about the planned laying of foundation stone for the new Ram Janambhoomi temple apart the divisive message has been spread to every small town if not every village thanks to the Ram Shila puja or consecration of bricks for taking to Ayodhya for building the temple in Lord Ramas honour Nor is the reckless and unhindered of tension over the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid, the example of perilous permissiveness about communalism Retrograde communal and obscurantist force also drew comfort in recent years by the scandalous handling of the Roor Kanwar sati episode in Rajasthar village The Prime Minister took three months to condemn the deplorable event The Janata Da chief spoke rather sooner but all hi could bring himself to say was that the incident was unfortunate the BJP leader in the Rajaslhan legislature openly and brazenly not only defended sati but also glorified it without ever inviting word of reproach from Mr LK Advani Atal Behari Vajpayee Add to this the fact that Mr Advani got himself photographed happily joining the Ram Shila puja in New Delhi and it becomes clear why no one is taken by the BJPs cries of injured innocence over the communal issue while some might be inclined to give other parties the benefit of. the doubt This brings one to another current sophistry which can be attributed only to the paralyzing fear of the poll In place after place in all the states which have witnessed communal bloodshed most notably in Bihar it has been seen that riots have been triggered by Ram Shila processions And yet neither the Centre nor Congress-ruled states where alone Hindu-Muslim riots have taken place so far are prepared to impose blanket ban on these processings Perhaps there is something to be said for the Prime Ministers argument since repeated by Mr Buta Singh that blanket ban might be provocative and might create difficulties because the government did not have enough police to enforce the ban Basil's Firm Step But then does not this argument apply to bans imposed after city or town has been devastated by communal fury ban to be useful should be imposed to forestall mischief not as sequel to it Moreover is there no possibility of mobilizing the support of the public and political parties at least those in agreement with the ban to enforce it Surely Mr Jyoti Basu also has his compulsions both electoral and administrative But to his credit he had no hesitation in insisting that those in Calcutta wanting to worship bricks were welcome to do so in their homes but he would not allow Ram Shila Puja in public places including Durga Puja pandals Anyone inclined to be critical of the Supreme Court for its refusal to interfere with Ram Shila processions should resist the temptation This is 1 political matter on which only political authority can decide if it has the will to do so The courts shall we 1 say out of court in this respect On his visit to Bhagalpur the Prime Minister was constrained to find fault with the police This was no surprise because in case after case of HinduMuslim violence sections of the police have disgraced themselves at Malliana near Meerut hundreds of Muslims were slaughtered by the UP armed constabulary Now accusing fingers are being raised against the Bihar military police Some months ago there was nasty riot at 1 Hazaribagh Its superintendent of police was immediately transferred to all places Bhagalpur
