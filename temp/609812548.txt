After Nellie in Assam last year Bhiwandi in Maharashtra now Indeed Bhiwandi is worse horror even if the number of victims is much smaller Nothing like this has ever been witnessed in independent India after the holocaust following partition The psychology behind the crime is so alien as to be incomprehensible To say that communal clashes have become virtually endemic in this industrial suburb of Bombav is to save little of an avance in the present context The roasting alive of over score of fellow Indians is not another communal clash It is materialisation of hell on earth While the horror is fact it is impossible to believe that this could have happened in any civilized society It feels like a terrible dream But we have witnessed an even worse horror Hie horror of indifference to the tragedy in Bhiwandi If our moral sensibilities had not been so benumbed as they appear to be two developments would have taken place on Saturday afternoon when the gruesome crime on the outskirts of Bhiwandi became public knowledge First the news would have sent such powerful waves at least in Bombay and its environs that even the worst communalists and gangsters acting in concert with them would have abandoned their plans to kill and burn Nothing of the sort happened In fact the situation in Bombay took turns for the worse on Saturday night so much so that at one stage it looked as if the police would not be able to cope with it and the authorities would have to call in the army Secondly the chief minister would have owned the moral responsibility for the tragedy one of the most shameful in our recent history and offered his and his -governments resignation Instead he criticised some Urdu papers for the role they had played in inciting communal passions This criticism might be justified but it is irrelevant and by design or otherwise it seeks to cover up the administration's failure We have supported Mr Vasantdada Patil in the past in the conviction that in the circumstances of the ruling Congress party he is the best bet for the state But the pertinent point now is that in the wake of the horror on the outskirts of Bhiwandi he should have regarded itobligatory on his part to send in his papers to the governor Perhaps it did not even occur to him that he should do so This is another indication of the distance we have travelled in the wrong direction since independence This is another expression of the deadening of our moral sensibilities and in sense it is as frightening as the roasting alive of fellow citizens in Bhiwandi. It can be argued that such gesture on Mr Patil's part would not have served any useful purpose That would be ridiculous argument For one thing the gesture would have been meaningful in itself as evidence that there are still politicians in this country who recognise such thing as responsibility For another it would have helped dissipate the atmosphere of cynicism and aroused the conscience of others Mr Lai Bahadur Shastri is still remembered for his resignation as minister for railways following rail accident in the fifties As it happened Mr Patil's responsibility can be pinpointed to begin with he allowed Shiv Jayanti procession in Bhiwandi and thus reversed 14-year-old policy And then his administration ignored the heated controversy between -section of the Urdu press and the Marathi press. over the Shiv Sena chiefMr Bal Thackeray's allegedly anti-Muslim utterance and the tension building as result of it So he just cannot disown responsibility for what has happened Wider MalaiseBut Mr Patils behaviour is symptomatic of wider malaise Political life in Maharashtra as in much of the city of India has touched newer and newer depths in years Two comparisons come to mind one of Nero playing music while Rome burnt and the other of the last days of the Moghul empire when princesses and courtiers indulged in intrigue and merrymaking as the British advanced and consolidated their lule In place of the British we have now the forces of anarchy on the march and the response of the ruling elite is very similar Thus when large parts of Bombay and adjoining towns were ready to explode into flames the state Congress leaders were wholly preoccupied with their factional infighting and of course the loot that has become part of government these days So only the innocent can be surprised that the administration failed to wake up to the gravity of the threat to law and order even when following an alleged insult to Mr Bal Thackeray by Congress legislator in Parbhani parts of Bombay were closed for two successive days on Wednesday and Thursday before riots broke out on Friday Indeed it is irrelevant to speak of an administration in Maharashtra Such thing ceased exist couple of years ago as result of the activities of political bosses at the helm In such situations it is only natural that the ordinary citizens faced with threats to their lives and properties should look up to Mrs Gandhi and the army to come to their rescue We ourselves have been flooded with pleas that we urge the Prime Minister to come to Bombay at once and post the army in trouble localities The performance of the Maharashtra police has been far from impressive We do not give credence to reports that policemen have in certain cases sided with the marathony have invariably come from outside the affected localities but the evidence of their lack of enthusiasm is too impressive for us to dismiss Perhaps the murder of sub-inspectors of police and head constable by anti-social elements out of personal vendetta on Friday might account for it partly But be that as it may the whole country has an enormous stake in an early return of normalcy to Bombay the nation's industrial- commercial heart The metropolis has hovered on the brink of precipice for three long days We cannot afford to see it collapse into the yawning abyss Such tragedy must be averted whatever it takes to do so including an extensive deployment of the army Too much damage has already been done to the confidence of the people in the efficacy of government There is no time to lose
