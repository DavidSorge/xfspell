Guilty men of Abmedabad By HARISH KHARE worst may be behind us 1 in the Ahmedabad battle but the war on the communal front in Gujarat is far from over However the most curious feature of the five-day- long orgy of violence is the absence of any visible objective that any vested interests could have sought to achieve Yet the intensity and extent of violence that overwhelmed Ahmedabad on April 6 was so total as to make observers wonder why the civic and the police administration could not cope with the vendors of violence for two daysApril 6 and 7 It seemed that Ahmedabad was in for prolonged bout of communal tension and violence and that the mischief-makers would continue to have the upper hand and even before the chief minister and his entourage could feel confident enough to abandon house and post and move back to Gandhinagar any number of theories were being circulated to explain the massive breakdown of civic order which claimed more than 40 lives in Ahmedabad and Baroda Some sections of the Ahmedabad police force and some BJP leaders have been contending that it was its administrative crackdown on the bootleggers that led to violence. This is an entirely self-serving argument advanced to enhance the impression that at least some sections of the BJP are free from allurements that bootleggers of Ahmedabad successfully offered to the entire political class in Gujarat The argument also is intended to suggest that sections of the Ahmedabad police force are not entirely hostage to the underworld controlled by the bootleggers. It has also been argued that sections of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the BJP worked as agents proThis again is far from satisfactory explanation Perhaps the only evidence that lends credence to the argument is the BJP leadership's failure to condemn the violence unequivocally Then there have also been isolated incidents of local level leaders shouting anti-Chiman Patch slogans The argument is that section of the BJP was unhappy that its stormy petrel Mr Ashok Bhatt was not given the home portfolio and violence was their way of showing Mr Chimanhhai Patch his But surely the BJP leaders are not so naive as not to understand that no chief minister whatever the constraints of coalition ministry would give in to the demands under such circumstances even if it is assumed that the BJP as whole would be interested in consolidating itself politically just as it has done in Madhya Pradesh it makes little sense for the BJP to want to create trouble so early in the ministry's tenure This thesis of the BJPs culpability does not explain though for different reasons it is useful to bandy about It does help divert public attention away from the problems and difficulties Mr Ashok Bhatt as civil supplies minister was bound to encounter in keeping the prices under control The theory of BJP culpability can make sense only if one assumes that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the BJP are so badly almost irredivided that the hotheads would become unmindful of the BJP's national political interests as well as the intense almost burning desire of Gujarat leaders to taste the crumbs of ministerial power Perhaps the real reason if not the immediate cause lies in the unending tampering with the professionalism of the Gujarat police particularly the Ahmedabad force The police commissioner Mr SN Sinha has been presiding over the Ahmedabad set-up now for more than three years and has been mollycoddled by political bosses in Gandhinagar to such an extent that some senior police officials accuse him of running fiefdom More pertinently the manner in which junior-level postings are almost auctioned has left the police force highly compromised both in body and mind. It stands to reason that if police inspector has to borrow money from bootlegger to procure lucrative posting in this or that police station he cannot be expected to be competent or conscientious guardian of law and order In the way those guilty of tampering with the Gujarat police arc no longer in power in Gandhinagar Our petty politicians must now realise that the efficacy of the law and order machinery has to be demonstratively established every day But if they insist on transferring police personnel four times in year then the society will have to continue to pay the kind of price Ahmedabad paid last week
