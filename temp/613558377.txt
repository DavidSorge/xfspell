When rumours spread like wildfire by Staff Reporter BOMBAY Dec II RUMOURS multiply exponentially they say Yesterday's panic over the alleged arrest of the Shiv Sena leader Mr Bal Thackeray and the subsequent scare about the rumoured death of the nonagenarian former prime minister Mr Morarji Desai afforded additional proof of this Ratnagiri newspaper rang this newspapers office in the city yesterday afternoon to request that an additional 300 copies of today's newspaper be despatched to him Everyone here is eager to read about the arrest of Mr Bal Thackeray he said When it was conveyed to him that was merely rumour he paused for while Then reduce my usual order by 1 000 copies he said Similarly Surat newsagent called with request for the augmentation of his usual quota The news of The former prime minister's death had already reached Surat he said He expected big business boom today But when the actual facts were explained to him he too withdrew last night staffers of this newspaper received calls from friends from places as far away as Bangkok asking for details of the situation following the unusual double occurrence in the city meanwhile telephone lines to many homes and offices continue to be jammed with characterless electronic voice droning into the subscribers ear that all lines on his chosen route are busy On Monday in fact the Bandra telephone exchange simply shut down when its computer decided it was unable to deal with all the incoming and outgoing calls For two-and-a-half hours panic spread through the area as people wondered whether the lines had been deliberately blocked by the MTNL or whether the exchange had been sabotaged The answer was simpler however according to Mr Achintya Mukherjee of the Bombay Telephone Users Association The fact is that there are simply not enough junction lines between exchanges to handle the volume of calls in crisis situations he said Because of the inadequate capacity of the junction lines he noted people were forced to make repeated call attempts thus further overloading the exchange For electronic exchanges the rate is something like 186000 call hour busy attempts he said After that exchange simply packs up More distressing was the fact that many people found themselves unable to get through to 100 the line for police assistance he said While the police claimed that the MTNL was not maintaining the circuits properly the latter reportedly stated that the police telephone boards were not being properly manned According to Mr Mkherjee The congestion they are talking about is not because of long conversations or because the busy call attempts have suddenly shot up but because so many people are trying to get through all at once He noted that the 1 86000 busy hour call attempts ratio was quite adequate Even for situations of crisis it is sufficient he felt But the junction lines are just so few that only very limited number of people are able to get through Meanwhile the sheer number of bodies flowing into coroners courts all over the city continues to hamper their functioning Today after two-month wait Mrs Pangajvalli Baby Chettiar took custody of her husband's body which arrived by Saudia flight at 1 030 am Mr Chettiar had died in Riyadh in October and his wife went through traumatic two-month wait for the body That trauma was further intoday after she received This corpse She had to first get it through the police officers at Sahar airport and then accompany it to the Cooper Hospital morgue There she waited until nearly 5 pm when it was finally released for the last rites All the while we were waiting the bodies continued to come in friend of hers told this newspaper In the morning about ten or 15 bodies came in from Jogshwan and later as we were leaving another ten or 15 arrived They were all charred and bleeding The sight made her sick Mrs Chettiar said But she was forced to wait there until the coroner arrived and released the body In addition to that three-hour wait the group had to wait two hours for policeman from the Sahar police station to arrive and identify the body Possibly they were upset over the influx of bodies Ms Cheltiars companions said But everything was so disorganised and uncoordinated We had to wait there unnecessarily for the police and the coroner to arrive By the time the body was released the sun was beginning to set Today was little less hectic for the authorities at Sion Hospital which with 196 cases from the Dharavi area alone during the last four days appears to have had the greatest. number of casualties among municipal hospitals Only one person was admitted to the hospital today as compared to the continuous flow on Monday They brought them in on handcarts and vegetable carts anything that was available sometimes three or four at the doctor said The majority of cases were gunshot wounds in the trunk and lower limbs the doctor said The injured were mostly men though there were also two women in the age group of 25 to 30 and child In the firing one man came in with bullet lodged near his spine the authorities said Another Sanjay Kulkarni apparently the son of police inspector died after being stabbed through the chest at the Kurla railway station He had wandered into the fracas by mistake Hospital authorities stoutly defending reports in the press regarding shortages of linen and foodstuffs the hospital We are fairly stocked until next week one official said Blood at least was not in supply at the hospital since blood donation drive was concluded just week before the incidents Even today blood donation drive was in progress at the hospital.
