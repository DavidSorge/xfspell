The Timco of India News Service HYDERABAD May 25 Congress image has faded 1 to blur in Andhra Pradesh in the wake of the two by-election results While byelection results are not always barometers of the fortunes in store for the political rivals in the next general election the manner in which the Congress party has been humiliated in Asifnagar Hyderabad has brought gloom to the Congress camp The result has also caused anxiety over the fate of the seven AP Central ministers in the coming Lok Sabha poll All of them are Lok Sabha members The party's glorious record of capturing all the 42 Lok Sabha seats in 1977 when the greater part of the country was swept by Janata Wave and its repeat performance in 1980 has already passed into history POOR CONGRESS TALLY On the other hand the Telugu Desam which lost to the Majlis in Asifnagar its stronghold last year by margin of 25000 votes reduced the gap to mere 1700 votes hi the byelection The Congress tally was just 5000 votes out of total. of 107000 votes polled This is less than five per cent The interpretation that the Asifnagar result is indicative of only communal polarisation is hardly convincing as the constituency has 50 per cent Muslim votes The very narrow margin of its victory therefore indicates that sizable chunks of these votes did not go to the Majlis Surely NTRs regional outfit is making successful thrust into the Telengana area where it did not fare as well as it did in Andhra in the 1983 assembly election In the Machilipatnam assembly byelection the Congress fared comparatively much better Its warring leaders had closed ranks and put up united fight The high spirit of the Congress after its triumph in the Pedapalli assembly byelection last November was reflected in the Machilipatnam electioneering Mr Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy Union transport and shipping minister and Mr Venkatasubbaiah Union minister of state for home had campaigned in Machilipatnam and attracted sizable crowds for their election rallies The plus factor for the Congress was the fact that the Telugu Desam could not find candidates of its own and had to nominate Mr Vadde Ranga Rao after engineering his defection from the Janata party just a few days before the last date for nomination Vadde the defector was the Congress plank Even some Janata leaders said that Mr Ranga Rao was kidnapped by NTRs party But the Telugu Desam won the battle though with reduced margin The Congress can draw solace from the fact that it polled 37 per cent of the votes this time compared to 23 in January last year. It also improved its base in the urban area of Bandai town The Telugu Desam stake in Machilipatnam was high It is part of the Krishna district Lok Sabha constitute home district of the chief minister Mr Rama Rao who had announced recently he would seek election to the Lok Sabha from this constituency If the Congress had won this seat NTR would have been forced to redraw his election strategy PARTY CRISIS Meanwhile the defeat in Machilipatnam has sparked an organisational crisis in the Congress The Pradesh party chief Dr Rajasekhar Reddy has resigned So has the youth Congress president Mr Chinna Reddy With the lobby for former chief minister Mr Vengal Rao has become active again demanding that he be made the party chief to revitalize the organisation To counter this move section in the party is demanding that Mr Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy quit the Central cabinet and take up organisational work An off-shoot of the Congress crisis is revival of the Kamma-Reddy struggle for supremacy in the party With the advent of the Telugu Desam Kammas became suspect in the eyes of the Congress leadership as Mr Rama Rao belongs to the Kamma caste In fact during the election campaign last January common Congress slogan caught on with the voters was whether they wanted Kanima or Amma the choice being between Mr Rama Rao and Mrs Gandhi Now with the party debacle the dormant Kammas have begun to assert themselves demand an equal role if not dominant position for them in the party The Congress predicament has been explained by the Krishna Zilla Parishad president Mr Sunkara Satyanarayana who survived Congress Confidence motion last month Said Mr Saiyanarayana The Congress tiger was wounded on May 4 when its motion was lost at the zilla parishad meeting It was killed on May 20 by the Machilipatnam voters
