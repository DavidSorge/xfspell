The National Scene An Incredible Agitation By THE recent Muslim agitation in Uttar Pradesh over book that was said to be offensive to Islamic sentiment appears most incredible whichever way one looks. at it But what is disquieting about the whole affair is that the violent demonstrations are the evident symptoms of deeper malaise of which all had thought the body politics had been rid after partition and the blood bath that followed it Seizing upon every pretext to whip up communal agitation offering wanton insult to the national sentiment and the national Hag and shouting proPakistan slogans are all of which prima facie can have only one object that of provoking communal disin country where Hindu-Muslim tension was fast fading out into past memory particularly in the face of the current linguistic passions SUICIDAL STEP Why should those claiming to be champions of the interests of the Muslim minority embark upon such suicidal step is the first incredible element about it? The likely explanation is that the agents provocateurs are foreigners Pakistanis whose Interest lies not in protecting the Muslim minority but in disaster communal peace and creating chaos in country which is developing reputation for an efficient government and stable economy in contrast to the political chaos and instability in Pakistan To such foreign agents the Muslims of this country are obno more than convenient pawns whose fate and security is no concern of theirs The evidence available indicates that much organisational skill and staff work has gone behind the agitation in UP and that It was not spontaneous outburst Telegraphic instructions are alleged to have been sent by Certain central directors to local leaders in various towns directing them in regard to the conduct of the agitation Yet another incredible element in the agitation is that whereas normal peaceful representation to the authorities would have achieved the object -the agitators appeared to be in hurry to seize upon the opportunity to whip up communal demonstration and indeed would not miss it for all they were worth As it turned out the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan promptly withdrew the book in question from while the states of Bihar and Bengal proscribed the book Mr Munshi President of the Bhavan made handsome public amends for the lapse It has to be remembered that the book on the life of the Prophet was originally published by an American publishing house and has been on sale in the markets of the world including Pakistan for the past fifteen years But all these years it occurred to none. to protest against the publication Equally incredible is that the agitators should ignore the prompt action taken by the authorities in response to their demand and continue the violent demonstration. even after the book is withdrawn from sale and the most incredible of all is the strange silence observed by the nationalist and Congress Muslim leaders whose failure to condemn the excesses committed by the misguided Muslim mobs was bound to be misunderstood in the country As this goes to press report has been received of Dr Zakir Hussain's farewell address to the students of Aligarh University which is the first ed condemnatory statement made by front-rank Muslim leader The 31 Muslim MPs who last week issued a statement condemning Pakistan for its policy on Kashmir would have rendered more valuable service to their country and their community if they had assumed leadership at this juncture and condemned the outbursts of communal violence which are suicidal because they provoke counter- violence from the fanatics among the majority community INSULTS Opinion is however unanimous in the country on one issue treasonable and antinational acts such as insulting the national flag and hoisting the Pakistani flag on buildings on Indian Independence Day can and should never be tolerated As it is there has been much discontent at the failure of the Prime Minister and Maulana Abul. Kalam Azad to condemn the violence of the Muslim demonstrators and the Government's failure in general to bring to book those misuses who have offered wanton insult to the national flag or publicly displayed their antinational sentiment by shouting slogans like Hindustan Murdabad Complaints have been loud and persistent that the Aligarh Muslim University continues to ism should be written into to be the hotbed of communal anti-national and pro-Pakistani activities and agitation It is in the interests of communal peace and harmony not only in Uttar Pradesh but in the entire country for the authorities to investigate these allegations and cleanse the augean stables once for all It is to be hoped that the reports that behind the current Congress-Akali negotiations is deal to secure for the Akalis dominance in the Regional Council in the Punjabispeaking region are not true Such eve-of-election political horse-trading is as different from merger of the Akali Dal with the Congress chalk roni cheese The unconditional entry of the Akalis into the Congress should have no strings whatsoever attached to it The setting up of candidates by the Congress in the State should be guided solely by two considerations merit and secular outlook of the candidate DANGER The inherent danger of communal group merging into the Congress as experience elsewhere in the country has proved is that comes on top and corrupts the Congress By any standards it is cynical political manoeuvre The least that the Congress High Command could do is to insist both to the letter and the spirit that communal groups merging with the Congress should eschew sectional and communal outlook and ideology If the Congress yields to the temptation to slur over principles for the sake of temporary electoral advantage in later years the party will have to reap the whirlwind Despite the secular mantra constantly chanted by Congressmen in practice the Congress party has allowed itself to be infiltrated by communalism casteism and provincialism Nothing brought home this bitter truth more graphically than the States reorganisation continued on Page 8 Column 7 Active Work For Secular Ideal STRESS ON MAJOR PARTYS ROLE Continued from Page 6 Column 5 troversy The Congress High Command should profit by the lessons learnt in recent months There can be no compromise between nationalism and countless it is to the detriment of the former There is no meeting ground between the two It is not enough that secular constitution of the country But the major political party should actively and honestly work for the secular ideal and eschew communalism in its day-to-day Conduct In UP and Malabar and elsewhere the Congress has hesitated to strike bargain with unrepentant Muslim Leaguers and even set them up as Congress candidates In other States the Pradesh Congress has been handed to rank co-leaders That be the easy way to win the elections but the damage done to the Congress and the country as whole in the process is tremendous The question of the chief ministership of the new Madhya Pradesh is once again on the tapis following rumours that Pandit Ravi Shankar Shukla may be offered Governorship Of State Until the issue appeared to be settled and everyone in the merging States including Pandit Shukla had taken for granted that the Chief Minister of the nucleus Madhya Pradesh will continue in that post in the new ed state There is not the least doubt that the new sprawling underdeveloped State of Madhya Pradesh with all its complex problems requires not only competent and energetic personality as Chief Minister but able administrator as GovernorDR 1 Anyone who holds the position of Chief Minister not only be competent but also enjoy the confidence of the regional group the lull backing of the High Command Ever though it would mean sacrinee 6r# Dr Kaiju to move down from Centre to State leader alone can fulfil the Aforementioned elements of 1 that key post in Maclhya Pradesh Besides it sounds plausible that Dr Katju may be fed by the High Command to accept the post in the context of Reports that Mr Mcrarji Desa desires to relinquish the chief ministership of Bombay Stat immediately and that he is to come to the Centre before the elections Equally important is the power of the Governor in June whose rst need is administrative welding and integration Only 2 Civilian of the of Mr Tovedi or Cr Rao car 4m
