Blessed left front By Our Special Correspondent CALCUTTA June 13 MR Zail Singhs statement on Tfipura in parliament yesterday seems to have eased the tension the ruling left front leaders had been suffering from ever since the Union home ministers visit to that state This is not to suggest that their worry about the future of the left front government in Tiipura has ended Some of them said. Knowing as we do the ways of Mrs Indira Gandhi we are keeping our fingers crossed The CPI state committee which is in session he took cautious note of Mr Singh's statement at the meeting the chief minister Mr Jyoti Basu had with Mrs Gandhi in Delhi early this week she referred to telegrams she had been receiving from Tripura alleging OFI misdeeds but when Mr Basu reportedly asked if she wanted to restore north-east India by unseating one state government after another Mrs Gandhi did not pursue the point further Mr Basu today to the Tripura chief minister Mr Nripen Chakraon telephone The latter was said to have requested Mr Basu to pursue certain points with Delhi relating to the post-riot situation there The latest reports reaching here say that airlift of security forces from outside Tripura complete Troops are engaged in combing operations in large areas but have not undertaken any counter-insurgency measures yet more bodies were recovered overnight taking the death roll to about 700 It is feared that the figure might go up to 1000 As security forces fan out aerial reconnaissance is being continued Till yesterday smoke was noticed corning out of clusters of burnt houses in several areas The total number of arrests till this morning was about 1400 An unspecified number of arms were recovered There was no report of any fresh major incident or encounters with the rebels Relief operations are being geared Mr Basu is understood to have been requested impress on Delhi the need to provide certain relief material urgently needed in Tipura where nearly 100,000 evacuees might have lost almost everything The West Bengal government is organising charter flight on Sunday to carry some more relief material as well as team of Bharat Sevasram volunteers POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT It is now learnt that in his letter to Mr Basu received here yesterday Mr Chakravorty had given his analysis of the rain of developments leading to the June 6 midnight carnage. He has explained that with the government's announcement about the Autonomous Hill areas council election on July 13 towards the end of May two parallel developments took place at the political level on the one hand the Congress and the Amra Baagali openly spoke of their determination not to allow the elections to take place On the other the extremist wing of the TUJS finalized its plan for large-scale violence to set up separate state The immediate compulsion for the letter according to Mr Chakravorty was that the OPI tribal organisation was making significant inroads into TUJS strongholds with its advocacy for the elections and the council scheme TUJS extremists programme as planned started on June 1 with boycott of markets Mr Chakravorty says that the call was an unexpected success affecting all the markets in the tribal belt This attracted his attention and led the government to that something was terribly wrong Intelligence gaps occurred during the period from June 1 to June 6 when tribal policemen started going on leave and finally it was found that many others had gone over to the side of the rebels with their arms Mr Ghakravorty claims that the Tripura government had unsuccessfully pleaded with the Centre during this period to send more CRP men to deal with the suspected developments It had asked for CiftP support from June 6 evening but was denied it was only after the leader of the CPI in parliament Mr Samar Mukherjee had taken up the issue personally that the government moved in this matter But outside forces started arriving from June 8 and it was already too late Despite administrative and other handicaps Mr Chakravorty feels that timely help may have averted the massacre and destruction to great extent The West Bengal government is seeking to tighten intelligence network and intensify vigilance over some ostensibly social service and religious organizations some lessons from Tripura latest experience The state government has been susable the activities of some such organisations which had spread to different parts of the state to provide relief after the 1978 floods District magistrates recently were instructed not to extend any official assistance to at least one of these organisations This particular organisation according to reports with the government started its socio-economic development activities in south 24-Parganas in early 1979 and has since gone over to MidIt allegedly receives funds through religious agency based in Barrackpore and affiliated to an all India organisation
