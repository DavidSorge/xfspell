Kashmir Shame Agony Bitter Truth Must Be Faced By INDER MALHOTRA TN the editorial columns on this page yesterday it was made crystal clear that the question in Jammu and Kashmir today is not whether the utterly discredited Mr Shah better known to the Kashmiris as Gulsha should go but how soon can this denouement be brought about He outlived his utility such as it was and even his futility has been under discussion for nearly a year long time ago Now he stands condemned for something so monstrous that its gravity can be fully appreciated only by those familiar with Kashmirs long and intricate history Let the issue be explained bluntly without beating about the bush While recurring Hindu-Muslim violence does disgrace the rest of the country from Aligarh in the north to Hyderabad. in the south and from Bhiwandi in the west to Jamshedpur in the east there has not been single communal riot of this kind in the Kashmir valley since 1931 when the late Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah threw the entire weight of his towering personality against those out to kill the Kashmiri pandits the only Hindus relatively few in number who live in the lovely but secluded area This glorious tradition of communal harmony in the Kashmir valley survived not only the sharp vicissitudes in the Sheikhs own political fortunes but also the subcontinental bloodbath before and after independence partition Kashmir invasion in 1947 first by tribal raiders and then regular Pakistani troops the constant Pakistani attempts to promote subversion and disruption across the line of control and the wars of 1965 and 1971 In September 1967 there was solitary blow-up over the alleged abduction of Kashmiri pandit girl but it was confined to the city of Srinagar and did not cause even ripple in the rest of the valley which contains many villages with only one home surrounded by hundreds of houses belonging to Muslim families Another pertinent fact in this connection often overlooked is that while the Hindus constitute large majority in the country as whole the Kashmiri pandit residing in his home state or elsewhere looks upon himself not as a member of the Hindu majority but as that of microscopic minority living in Muslim-majority region This complex is exacerbated especially in times of tension or uncertainty by the Kashmiri pandits deep-seated and hair-raising historical memories For there was a time in the distant past when his community number was reduced to precisely eleven families Srinagar Mosque It is against the painful and complex backdrop that both the preservation of communal peace in Kashmir during the last 55 years and its eventual destruction under Mr Shah's rule must be seen To be fair highly offensive slogans against Kashmiri pandits have been raised in the valley especially in Srinagar and other major towns also during previous regimes including that of Farooq Abdullah But never before has the situation been allowed to get out of control. It is Mr Shah's dubious distinction to have allowed the valley justly proud of its record of communal harmony to be plunged into wanton orgy of violence looting burning of minority homes and shrines and so on Indeed not to put any gloss on the unspeakable goings-on the point must be made that there is no way in which the Shah ministry can wash its hands of direct responsibility for the competitive carnage that first began in Jammu and then speedily spread to the Kashmir valley especially to the Anantnag area ironically once Congress stronghold despite the National Conference dominance of the valley as whole Before outlining briefly the course of events and their ugly consequences major misimpression surprisingly widespread must be put out of the way Misinformation would perhaps be more appropriate expression for this impression being sedulously fostered by some than what Kashmir has witnessed is the fall-out of the unfortunate tension and trouble in the rest of the country in the wake of the Shah Bano case and the controversy over the Ram Janma Bhoomi and Babri mosque fanned by tests and fundamentalists The only small element of truth in this myth is that some cassettes of highly inflammatory speeches by certain Mr Kazmi against the Shah Bano judgement were in fact circulated in parts of Kashmir just as the Bhindranwale tapes have been doing the rounds in Punjab This could have added fuel to the fire But the fire that swept Jammu and Kashmir was lit locally for purely local reasons Ayodhya and Babri masjid were never even mentioned though ironically. similar drama entirely local in character did become the spark that lit the fuse in Jammu and for which Mr Shah cannot escape his share of culpainful Backdrop In Srinagar mosque has existed in the state secretariat since the early fifties though there has been none in the Jammu secretariat from where the state government operates during the winter months This never inconvenienced even Sheikh Abdullah who was as regular with his name as General Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan is today but for reasons best known to him Mr Shah suddenly decided to set apart some area of the Jammu secretariat too. use as mosque This caused sharp reaction among the local Hindus particularly because the spot chosen for the mosque was memorial to woman who is said to have committed suicide during the Dogra raj By quirk of irony the group that took the strongest objection to mosque-building in the secretariat was Shi Sena an organisation that had originally come into being in Jammu as counter-blast to the Sikhs extremists allegedly supported or at least tolerated by Dr Farooq Abdullah but had virtually gone out of existence after the Punjab accord It was brought back to life by the Shah ministry presumably. to demonstrate that it had some support among the Jammu Hindus outside the Congress and Jana Sangh folds To appease the Shiv Sena Mr Shah wound up the secretariat majid The Sena turned the occasion. into something of victory celebration which infuriated another lumpen organisation this one of Muslim youth which also supports the Shah ministry It demanded permission to take out procession. Officials demurred but were overruled by ministers who have since been issuing cowardly denials of having done so Inevitably the Shiv Sena too insisted on taking out procession of its own The two processions first exchanged objectionable words These quickly degenerated into clash during which Muslim shop was looted and many Muslims some of them outstated labourers were beaten up Truckloads of Muslims fled Jammu and as they crossed the BanihaJ spread blood-curdling stories of atrocities committed on them and their Muslim brethren Some of what they said was clearly exaggerated just as some. accounts of what has happened in the valley may also be But the damage already done is stupendous The talk of Kashmiri pandits wanting to migrate from the valley unthinkable until last month has begun At first the Shah ministry sat on its hands doing virtually nothing to control the chaos It then compounded its acts of omission by those of commission As so many different newspapers have reported. its belated intervention has been so ham-handed that instead of improving the situation it has worsened it Ban Rescinded Herein perhaps lies the crux of the problem The wily Mr Shah has evidently convinced himself obviously not without reason that no matter what monstrosity he perhaps blandly rescinded the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami without consulting Delhi those who installed him in power in the first place on July 2 1984 can be persuaded to leave him well alone There can be no other explanation for the fact that while the state governor Mr Jagmohan the Congress in and with whose support alone can Mr Shah rule and all opposition parties have been clamouring for Mr Shah's ouster New Delhi has been giving him reprieve after reprieve The repeated disregard of Mr Jagmohans advice may be explained by the fact that while he wants governors rule followed by fresh elections which would -almost certainly lead to Dr Farooq Abdullah victory and the Congress party's rout the local Congress leaders power to be handed over to them hook or by crook But two events are inexplicable indeed baffling First after Mr Rajiv Gandhi won his stunning election victory in January 1985 Dr Farooq Abdullah saw him and gave him the choice of either sacking Mr Shah or facing an agitation in Kashmir this issue He went back to Srinagai with the clear impression that Mr Shah would go at the latest by March Dr Farooq Abdullah is still ruing his credulity Secondly from all accounts Mr Arjun Singh the Congress vice-president returned from his recent visit to Srinagar convinced that Mr Shah must be sent packing What followed was resounding declaration by Mr Rajiv Gandhi that the Kashmir chief minister would stay Evidently Mr Arun Nehru Mr Chavan is only figurehead in the Union home ministry and Mr Makhan Lai Fordar whose status is indefinable have much greater say on Kashmir than the gentleman who is former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh former governor of Punjab and former Union commerce minister Throwing politeness to the winds it should also be recorded that Mr Shah is not without capacity to blackmail the Kashmir Congress leaders because they have partaken of his lot of the state The Centre too is in quandary because to dismiss or even alienate Mr Shah now would mean an even greater loss of seats to the Congress party in the coming Rajya Sabha poll than otherwise but must such petty considerations prevail over wider national interests in sensitive state as Kashmir word to the Shah of Kashmir is also in order He should go while the going is good Or else he might have to ro the way of Shah of Iran The second part of Mr Prem Shankar Jha article will appear on Saturday.
