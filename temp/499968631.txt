Joshi charged the Congress with trying to spread communal poison in the country and wondered whether the secret parleys between Mr Sanjay Gandhi and Mr Raj Narain were not responsible for such incidents Mr Vijay Kumar Malhotra Java nata alleged that some people were trying to derive political advantage from keeping Muslims and Hindus separate and divided The Congression was trying to create an atmosphere of anarchy in the country Mr Malhotra said the RSS was working to remove the misunderstanding on Page 9 Column 1 The police using lathis to disperse Congress demonstrators in Calcutta on Thursday -TOI Motion on Dadri clash fails Continued from Page 1 Column 8 standings among the Muslims and bring them closer to it Prof Samar Guha Janata in similar vein 9 condemned those politicals who were roaming all over the country to gain political mileage out of clashes and attack Prof Guha said that by attacking RSS its critics were attacking the Janata and ultimately the Prime Minister The most significant contribution in the third group came from the home minister even though he suffered setback in the political game by refusing to divulge the information he possessed in the first instance The home minister began by saying that the debate have been more useful and productive if it had been held later when fuller information about the incident was available His remark that the Central governments writ did not run in UP forced Mr Stephen leader of the opposition to his feet to dub it ax astounding Mr Patel replied that Mr Stephen had tried deliberately to misunderstand his observation What he meant was that law and order was state subject and he had to depend on information from the UP government The UP government had so far given no report However he had been able to collect some information from the district authorities in Aligarh and Dadri Mr Patel said that the version given by the Aligarh Muslim University students told only one side of the story and telegrams received by him gave a totally different version but he would not like to read them out since the information was not yet complete The home minister expressed surprise that several members even Mr Chavan who is so experienced an administrator -y had jumped to conclusions without knowing exactly what had happened at Dadri Mr Patel described the incident as deplorable but emphasized that he did not know the full facts and it would be rushing to conclusion to say that it was an RSS operation The home minister agreed with the speakers that the secular character of the country was too valuable to be put at jeopardy and assured them that steps would be taken to prevent recurrence of such incidents and those found guilty would be punished GOVT BLAMED Appealing to members to refrain from giving it communal colour he said that already tense situation had developed in Aligarh and they all must be very careful about what they said In an aside the home minister chastised those politicians who visited Jamshedpur for a few hours and claimed to have discovered everything He said the authorities would go into the Dadri incident very thoroughly and find out what happened He thought that an official inquiry would be quite sufficient. When the incident was first raised in the house it created big uproar and the speaker finally gave his consent to full debate on an adjournment motion in the afternoon Mr Banatwala who initiated the debate described the Dadri incident as pre-planned in which lathis hockey sticks and even firearms had used He said the government had failed to protect the students this inhuman and fascist attack The students were on their way to Delhi to protest against the governments stubborn attitude in this amendment to restore the minority status to Aligarh Muslim University Mr Banatwala said adding Attempts are being made to intimidate the Muslim minority from raising its voice in matters of the nature Mr Chimanbhat Shukla Janata thought that small incident had been exaggerated by merchants of who were keen to secure people's voles to return to power He said that the Muslims were being misled about the RSS Mr Sayeed Cong-I demanded thorough probe into the incident and referred to statements by Mr Raj Narain and Mr Madhu Limaye that such riots were organised by the RSS Mr Vasant Sathe Cong-I referred to black car with two motorcycles following the train in which the students travelled and blamed sinister fascist organisation giving para-military training to members Mr Chandrappan CP1 said the attack on students was not accidental and alleged that the RSS was trying to propagate theory of Hindu rashtra and attacking the minority community whenever an opportunity offered Mr Chavan said the Muslims had reason to complain about what happened in Aligarh Jamshedpur and elsewhere This dangerous trend must be stopped. He asked the government to accept the minority character of Aligarh Muslim University Mrs Ahilyabai Rangnekar CPM wanted an atmosphere of national integration to be created so that the minorities did not suffer RAJ ATTACKS RSS Mr Raj Narain denied the charge that he was creating communal tension in the country and launched fierce attacks on the RSS His remark that Mr Vajpayee spent only seven days in jail in 1942 and became an approver to get release provoked strong protests from 1 Janata members Mr Mohammed Shafi Quereshi Cong criticised that the Prime Minister spent only 15 minutes during the debate and when he woke up he walked away he said there could be no hope of justice for the minorities which the RSS aggressors were sitting by the side of the Prime Minister Dr Murli Manohar Joshi remarked that Mr Banatwala had not claimed any personal knowledge of the incident and asked Can this house get excited over rumour and suspicion Mr Banatwala in his reply to the debate had no doubt that it was preplanned and organised attack on the students and he deplored the barren assurance given by the government that action would be taken against the culprits In the Rajya Sabha Mr Bhupesh Gupta CPI shared the view expressed by Mr Khurshed Alam Khan Cong-I Mr Mohammed Yunus Safeem and Mr Syed Hashmi both Cong and Mr Souren Bhattacharya RSP that the attack on the Aligarh students appear to be pre-planned Janata members like Mr RaSingh Mr Sadashiv BaMr Bhattacharya and Mr Ladli Mohan Nigam received cheers from the Congress benches for their outspokenness and strident criticism of their government Replying to questions Mr Dhanik Lai Mandal minister of state for home affairs told Mr Kamlapati Tripathi leader of the opposition that the incident was matter of concern and deserved to be condemned by all those who supported secularism He said that the alt-governor -of Pelhi personally supervised arrangements for medical assistance to 20 of the 72 injured students While of these were discharged after first aid six of the 20 ed had suffered serious injuries In the Lok Sabha the home minister was involved in sharp exchanges with opposition members But most unusual skirmish of 1 the evening took place between the speaker Mr Hegde and Mr Quereshi Mr Quereshi got up just as Dr Murli Manohar Joshi was about to conclude his speech and charged the speaker with being partial the members of the ruling party in giving greater latitude in time Mr Hegde firmly denied the charge and Prof Samar Guha angered by Mr Queresh's remarks sprang to his defence to say that the honour of the speaker was the honour of the house There was one moment of acute embarrassment for the treasury benches when the speaker sustained the objections raised by opposition members to bar the home minister from giving some additional information about the incident Although several Janata members including the law minister Mr Shanti Bhushan pleaded with the to use his discretion and allow the home minister to read from the account of the incident given by the railway authorities Mr Hegde decided otherwise. He argued that the information was with the home minister when the latter made his reply to the debate and in spite of specific request then made by Mr Kanwar Lai Gupta Mr Patel had refused to share it with the house The speaker therefore saw little point in allowing Mr Patel to do so in that the move of the motion had exercised his right of reply The government was saved second embarrassing moment when Congress member objected to the presence of member of the Rajya Sabha law minister at the time of division Following the speakers remark to him that they dont want you here the law minister rose from his seat and walked few steps towards the exit Just then the deputy prime minister and defence minister Jagjivan Ram and some other Janata members intervened to say that the law minister had right to be present though he could not take risk in the division Mr Shanti Bhushan walked back to the front row and resumed his seat
