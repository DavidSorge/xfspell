Forensic expert to probe Adivasi death By Our Special Correspondent BHOPAL April 4 ACID officer of the rank of DIG and reputed forensic expert Dr Hireshchandra have been sent to Jagdalpur to probe alleged burning alive of an Adivasi school girl on March 15 Two judicial officers who are alleged to have interfered with the police seizure of incriminating evidence were promptly transferred by the chief justice on the request of the government which is trying to build up as thorough case as possible against the culprits The chief minister Mr Saklecha who made these revelations in the video sabha yesterday however rejected the demand of the opposition for judicial inquiry into possible rape and murder by burning. He said such an inquiry would not only be improper but might hold up the investigation already launched The entire Congress opposition then walked out This annoyed the chief minister He said the intention of the Congress seemed to be only to provoke the Adivasis This was clear from the behaviour of former minister Mr Bhanwarlal Porte who had not only indulged in hysteric shouting but had also torn papers He had openly said the Adivasis would take to arms if they were not given protection POST-MORTEM REPORT Mr Saklscha also criticised the Congress leader Mr Vasantrao Uikey for citing another case of drowning of two girls as an instance of atrocity. He said the case was so evident that no post-mortem had been held Why should man of the stature of Mr Uikey spread such case? In the Jagdalpur case Mr Saklecha said there was contradiction in the demand that the peon  whose compound the charred body of the girl was found to be arrested and that he be given police protection The post-mortem examination report that the was due to suffocation by burning was also being examined The leader of the opposition Mr Arjun Singh pointed to the circumstances that led to public agitation on the death The charred body was not examined for rape None had been arrested so far The first press reports were censored locally Mr Visheshwar Prasad and Adivasi Janata front bencher amid cheers from Congress benches warned the government that it could not take shelter behind the fa that crimes against Harijans and Adivasis were not unknown during the Congress rule It could no longer be denied that they were on the increase if the government continued to hide behind comparative figures the blood of Adivasis might boil over one day The story that emerged from opposition speeches indicated that the girl was called out to the house of the point at night and that she did not go to any drama as made out by some There was dinner party attended by high judicial officers lawyers and forest contractor It was case of rape followed by murder to hide if it was alleged Cong urges probe into Sambhal riots By Our Special Correspondent NEW DELHI April 4 The Congress has demanded judicial inquiry into last week's riots in Samnear Motadabad in UP factfinding mission sent by the party to Snabbal have condemned the district authorities and the state government for their failure to protect the citizens of Sambhal The team was led by Mr Ramanand Yadav and Mrs Pramila Chauhan MPs It has reported that the incidents were preplanned and part of bigger design to disturb communal harmony and create tension in the country.
