This time Bihar did show the way News analysis By AKV1NI DAS NL-W December 15 IT is time to give the devil its due When most of India was going through free of killings in the wake of the demolition of the Babri Masjid Bihar which has record of horrendous communal massacres remained relatively quiet The casualty figures in the state do not appear to be low but they must be seen in the perspective of the mass killings in Jamshcdpur and Bhagalpur Ranchi and Hazthat have repeatedly given lie to the Bihars claim that it is the region where Buddha and Mahavir had originated their philosophy of Ahimsa The proverbial lawlessness of the state is reputation as region where indeed the slate had long withered away and its history of communal carnages which had once led Jawaharlal Nehruy to threaten to resort to aerial bombs that provide the backdrop of Bihar which surprisingly maintained law and order when the very rule of law was being questioned in other more civilised parts of India It is time to give the devil its due Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav the chief minister of Bihar long derided by the sophisticated urban intelligentsia for his rusticity stood firm as the upholder of the constitution and par excellence practitioner of when other better-equipped players of the political game were being taken for ride naively relying on the assurances and promises of voodoo politicians. Give the devil its due When Congressmen around the country were paralysed by shock leaders of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee BPCC Dr Jagannath Mishra and Mr Hidayatullah Khan alike responded with the markable non-partisan alacrity in joining Mr Yadav in maintaining the peace Jive the devil is due When the 1 eft in much of the rest of the country was only recovering from the realisation of its impotence in preventing the demolition of monument to India's historical heritage and was still searching for slogans and discussing the formation of secular front the LcA in Biharthe IPF the CPI the CPM and all the other myriad groups of its spectrum poured its cadres out into streets and villages to ensure peace Give the devil its due When the bureaucracy and the police administration in the rest of the country was still looking at rule books and consulting manuals on how to tackle national calamity the administration in Bihar acted with amazing speed and firmness It became the responsibility of district magistrates and police superto maintain peace in their areas of jurisdiction and by and large they did not fail Give the devil its due When the press in the rest of the country was still licking the wounds inflicted on it by the hoodlums at Ayodhya the ordinarily cantankerous press in Bihar got around to reporting not just killings but also peace not just tension also instances of ground-level popular amity Give the devil its due Bihar for once stood as proud constituent of secular India How did it do it The unexpected was achieved both through the series of strong and quick administrative responses as well as by speedy mobilisation of the ordinary secular people Even before Mr LK Advani resumed his interrupted rath yatra from Varanasi Bihar was on full alert It is significant that while Mr Advani proclaimed this latest round of his travels as continuation of his journey of 1990 he did not begin in Samaslipur in Bihar where he had been forced to gel off his juggernaut then Discretion became the better part of communal valour But Bihar was not unresponsive to what was being done in Uttar Pradesh While the administration geared itself under the watchful eyes of Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav to tackle any emergency hundreds of political activists of secular parties from Bihar travelled to UP to confront the kar sevaks The little reported clashes at the Charbagh railway station of Lucknow between the kar sevaks and the 1PF activists was one indication of secular mobilisation in Bihar Sociologically secularism was in Bihar by what has derisively termed the MY factor Muslim-Yadav combination crafted by Mr laloo Prasad Yadav In other respects too Mandal prevailed over the Mandir in Bihar particular administrative action in Bihar which proved efin preventing the spilling over of instant reaction into continued carnage was the prompt arrest of the kar sevaks as they returned from Ayodhya bearing the trophies of their vandalism in the of bricks and stones of the devastated Babri Masjid Mr Yadav had been in constant telephonic touch with his administrative mentor Mr Jyoti Basu as well as with the chief minister of Orissa Maharashtra Gujarat and Karnataka were aware of the pattern of violence that accompanied the returning kar sevaks Pre-emptively therefore he ordered the arrests of kar sevaks as their trains entered Bihar They were rounded up and kept in quarantine confinement in an institute of Bihla occasioning their leaders to vainly plead before the Patna high court for their release Other indications of firm political-administrative measures were provided through more than 1000 preventive arrests asking for army assistance immediately after the Ayodhya outraged personal inspections of the law and order machinery by the Haroun-AI-Rashid chief minister at dead of night of sniffer dogs to trace bombs and other explosives one dog called Sango alone helped uncover 23 bombs and countrymade pistol in the Palna city area and the neutralisation indeed positive secularisation of the Yadavs who had played important roles in the 1893 1917 1946 1967 and 1989 riots in Bihar at the popular political level so many rallies and peace marches were conducted in Bihar by different political parties separately or jointly including one within hours of the destruction of the Babri Masjid jointly by the Janata.
