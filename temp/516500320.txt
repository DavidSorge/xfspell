He Gall Asiad BvTRJVAIH AFTER 23 people had phoned me their congratulations and still didnt know why arid they wouldnt tell me because they thought knew it was hedging and wouldnt take my word for it that knew nothing the 24th caller put me wise by being more specific All the best old man he said understand that youre to be associated with the Asian GamesThis hit me right out of the blue and if didnt totter it was because Id already had three steadying whiskies But it certainly tended me for the first thought that occurred was that1 might have been included in the volley-ball team And the last Id played the game was when had sauntered into the field quite by chance and ball bounced off my head before could dodge it While it is great honour to be associated with the Asian Games an event so prestigious that half of Delhi is being dug up for it no one in his right mind would want to be entered for the wrong event and so stand to lose such dignity as he possesses It was therefore vital much trepidation that asked my friend in what manner I'd be involved with the Mini-Olympics Im glad that Im the first to be able to tell you said you are to be the official humorist to the games They have an official drink an official pedestal fan and an official All approved by the Asian committee This is the first time they have chosen -a human There are several visions in my mind many of them simultaneously Quarter-page ads and half-page ads in the newspapers all of them financed by myself No joke this roared the body-copy for one but Asiad chooses Triyadi Trivadi to the fore shrilled Another third said more modestly You choose right when you choose Trivadi and showed me sprinting what looked suspiciously like the 100 metres What will have to do in return No high-jumping guess Good heavens no Youll be -allowed the run of the house so to speak1 You will be moving from camp to camp telling jokes and keeping up the sportsmen's morale And if nobody laughs asked fair question Humour is strictly regional as you know and didnt suppose the Malaysians would laugh to hear about the priest in Kumbakonam who found his wig missing Just too bad for you if nobody laughs The official referee has to say off his head I want nd part of it This is like medieval times It is the kind of thing that happened to court jesterswas joking said my friend At the worst you will be asked to participate in the 10000 km hopskip-and-jump The health drink will be drunk the pedestal fan will whirr happily the watercooler will supply on tap and the poor human will have had it world
