Riot after riot three-way collusion between the police ganglords and unscrupulous politicians is responsible for the recurring riots in Ahmedabad discovers Ashraf Sayed Till hot in Die Coincauldron of Aliiiiinliib id it Mirju11 1 Uiut mm Kalupur Dariiipur and Shalipur iix-lli of curfew out for three in IBS police and ivu and at times maw killing have occurred in these ureas with alarming regularity it used to be battle between the people and the police but now the character of the conflict has changed with fundamentalism gaining ground over the years However the main characters have not changed Anti-social element particularly bootleggers still play major role in conflicting with the police politicians and religious bigots There was time when Uie Congress was suspected to be the main culprit is the turn of the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP with its blatantly Hindu card designed to instil fear in the minds of the minority community The BJPs hand in the shook Uie area on July 2 during the procession of Lord Jagannath is dear The police it is alleged is in league with the bootleggers Whether it is the don of Dariapur Abdul Wahab Abdul Latif Shaikh popularly known as Latif Bhai or Sudhakar Raos gang they cannot operate their flourishing business without the connivance of Uie police It is mystery therefore why the police acted over at midnight against few bootleggers who were allegedly smuggling truck in to Dariapur just a few hours before the way to pass through the sensitive area The ensuing events sent tension soaring in Uie locality and paved the way for the next days violence This raises many questions Who is ruling the city Are Uie going to dictate terms for peace Why did Uie police not take precautionary steps despite knowing about Uie previous night's episode According to reliable sources large posse of policemen including at least 236 sub-inspectors in the senior officers were deployed in the tense area to maintain vigil on potential mischief-mongers However they could not prevent the outbreak of violence The BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP along with many other religious organizations have accused members of Uie minority community of throwi stone on the procession At Uie same time it is well-known fact that at least two trucks not registered by the police surreptitiously joined the procession These trucks allegedly carried volunteers not cleared by the Jagannath Temple authorities and the police The volunteers armed with stones raised inflammatory slogans while passing through Uie Kalupur-Dariapur belt where Uie procession was reported to have been stoned Neither Uie BJP leader Mr LK Advani nor Uie VHP leaders could explain at the press conferences held after the violent incidents how these trucks sneaked into Uie procession After the riots erupted in the Dariapur locality these trucks passed through Shahpur where fresh bout of group clashes broke out While passing through Ashram Road these miscreants singled out shops belonging to Uie minority community and set them on fire For Uie sins of few bootleggers the entire city burnt for Uie next three days The 21 lives and damaged property worth crores of rupees Not single bootlegger connected with the incident nor the processionists who wreaked havoc have so far been arrested Over the years the city police force has been highly politicized and communalised During successive riots since 1969 the police have given the impression that it is on the side of the law-breakers Frequent transfers of senior officers on Uie whims and fancies of the politicians in Gandhi Nagar have further demoralised Uie police force The new home minister Mr CD Patel has yet to prove his mettle His recent performance has not inspired confidence He seems to be guided more by the police officers and bureaucrats than by his own wishes And then there are several senior party leaders who are trying to him on matters of serious importance The riots have helped the BJP to put Uie Chimanhhai Patel government on Uie mat Fust the party started the farmers agitation in Saurashtra and other parts of the state kit it did not get much political mileage from It then began Uie jail bharo agitation in protest against Uie Janata Dal Congress merger This was also more or less failure The students agitation led by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad asking for admission for all colleges also failed to dick because Uie Gujarat University authorities found solution to Uie imbroglio in the nick of time The BJP gilt-edged opportunity to strike effectively at the Patel ministry The disturbances in Ahmedabad Baroda Surat Morvi Sidhpur and Visnagar sent panic waves through Uie administration But it remains to be seen whether the religious frenzy whipped up by the riots will benefit the BJP in the coming municipal election in the The image has taken battering in the wake of the violtoot Nothing Ulintnto that better than Uie fact that even Mr Advani who visited the riothic areas of the city did not demand the resignation of that Patel Sociologists are exercised over the free quoit recurrence of communal violence in the Dariapur Shahpur-Kalupur labour bdC Although it is difficult to pinpoint the principal cause of incidents it is widely JeH that the poor economic condition that obtain in the area have to do with the repeated outbreak of riots The former Prime Minister Janata Dal leader Mr VP Singly during visit to the riot-hit dtL suggested that parliamentary committee should visit the Dariapur-Shahpur Kalupur are to ascertain the sodoreasons behind the violent tendencies of Uie people there However all said and done there is mi escaping Uie fact that Uie police criminal nexus and the activities of political parties out to exploit Unite communal susceptibilities of the people for political ends are mainly to blame for the riot that have become regular occurrence in Ahmedabad af Policemen trying to subdue rioter hi Ahmedabad Eeoaonfe
