Politics behind AP riots By VIKRAM RAO The Times of India News Service HYDERABAD POLITICAL tensions tend to explode into communal riots in Hyderabad where the two major communities lived in harmony for over two centuries until few years ago when religious zealous zealots began to demonstrate their piety in the streets The communal riots that the city of the Charminar into distress thrice in the past seven months indisputably were of political origin This is not to deny the deep-rooted mistrust that exists between the two communities which may be traced to the Razakar movement towards the end of the Nizam rule But politicians are known to inflame the latent communal prejudices whenever it suits their purpose and the ferocity of the riots have been increasing with each recurrence Take for example the latest riots which broke out on March 22 It all started with the death of an illicit liquor dealer in the excise office 1 here The victim was reported to have been taken there and beaten. by excise officials and hirelings of liquor contractors His death led to trouble in the Dhoolpet area and curfew was imposed In the police almanac of 1 Hyderabad curfew has become as common as prohibitory order under the Cr PC The details of this incident which have surfaced now make sad reading The Lodhi Rajput community has inhabited Dhoolpet for decades They keep swords claiming to be Kshatriyas Most of them trade in illicit liquor though many of its youths now go for modern education and urban employment. One of the illicit liquor dons Amar Singh had become an eyesore for the liquor contractors who found their business dwindling because of his trade which is more popular among the lower classes Their hirelings along with the exercise officials raided the house of Amar Singh's son in the Sitaphalmandi area in Secunderabad While his family members were allegedly assaulted Amar Singh was taken to the excise department office from where he was rushed reportedly dead to the Osmania General Hospital The story should have ended here But as tension mounted in the Dhoolpet area the restive Lodhis wielding arms cried revenge Just at that time mad man to quote the city police threw stones at baraat party marriage procession There were some altercations and skirmishes The events got mixed up and purely law-and-order problems turned into communal clash The Lodhis live in an area adjoining Muslim locality Some allege that the city police to divert the Lodhis wrath against the excise officials engineered the communal violence The logic of this argument is that the death of Amar Singh could have triggered violent demonstrations against the excise outfit creating embarrassment for the newly elected chief minister In communal clash the government and its officials have no direct involvement except in the efforts to contain it So the incident changed its contours and the old city saw yet another communal flare-up Only fortnight ago when polling ended state assembly there was trouble and curfew was imposed 3n old Hyderabad The origin of the trouble was again political The curfew of the Chandrayanagutta assembly seat were nominees of the Muslim Majl and the Congress besides Telugu Desam-supported independent In some polling booths more votes were found than the number of ballot papers issued and many of them did not have the polling officers signatures That was the reason for the election commission to order repoll The Muslim Majlis candidate and the TD-supported independent fought the election keenly but communal passions overtook the political battle The worst riot in the recent past was the one which rocked the city on September 9 It was the day of imof Ganapati idols in the Hussain Sagar tank when the city and state were already rocked by violent agitation over the dismissal of the NTR ministry by governor Ram Lad and installation in its place of the usurper Bhaskara Rao government Tension was already high but the cause was purely political On the fateful day of September 9 huge Ganapati idol and of many other gods of the Hindu anthem were taken in long procession through the Muslim-inhabited Charminar area Ironically many Arya Samajists who do not believe in idol worship were heading the procession Predictably communal clash occurred In the mindless violence that followed shops owned by the minority community in The fashionable Abids area and Basheerbag were set ablaze Several of these shops were marked with paint before the arsonists went into systematically judicial inquiry into progress but there is an allegation that Mr Bhaskara Rao to divert the wrath away from him turned on communal passion Many Hindus and Muslims of old Hyderabad have told this correspondent that they want peace and their normal life is affected because curfew immobilises them frequently Poor daily workers like the rickshawpullers small shop-owners and vendors suffer the most under curfew They are against riots An old resident of Chandrayanagutta says the knives used in the riots now are also of different types They were never found in Hyderabad before The Muslim Majlis alleges that they are brought from Nagpur RSS headquarters while BJP leaders say they are from Lucknow and Rampur UP But these knives kill Hyderabadis both Hindus and Muslims
