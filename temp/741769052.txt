Govt laxity blamed for UP dashes by SHARAT PRADHAN LUCKNOW ACK of political will is responsible for the UP government's failure to curb communalism which has grown particularly since the unlocking of Ram Janambhoomi temple in Ayodhya in February last year More than dozen communal dishes have occurred in one year in different parts of the state while tension continues Not only has there been three- fold increase in the number of communal parties or groups but the spate of incidents is unprecedented even while the situation is clearly worsening every day fanatic bodies have been allowed to flourish Such organisations whether Hindu or Muslim are exploiting the religious emotions of the man on the street who invariably get carried away by slogans in the name of Ram Janambhoomi or Babri. Masjid government which often proclaims its faith in secularism does not check the proliferation1 of communal pressure groups and the rise in fundamentalism Mrs Indira Gandhi had imposed a ban on all such parties or groups However in short span of three years after her assassination not only have they grown in number but even their objectionable activities have gone on unabated communal slogan inflammatory public speech or any other provocative act is not uncommon in any part of the state GOVT STRATEGY Opposition leaders allege that the government's inaction in the matter was part of the ruling party's strategy to win over the fundamentalists Perhaps that was why the state government disallowed the Faizabad district administrations plea that it did not foresee communal trouble due to the unlocking of the Ram Janambhoomi The RSS was the avowedly Hindu organisation until quite recently but now with the revival of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP at least four new powerful fanatics groups have come up while the Ram Mukti Yagna Samiti has primarily been in the limelight the Bajrang Dal the Shiv Sena and the Hindu Jagran Samiti are not far behind in propagating militancy in the name of religion Ostensibly to counter the alleged designs of the fanatic Hindu groups Muslim fundamentalists have raised nearly half-a-dozen fanatic groups As against the sole Jamaat-e-Islami in the past today there is the Babri Masjid Action Committee the Sunni Youth Federation the Ali Sena the Adam Sena the Sunni Youth Action Committee the Shia Youth Action Committee and the Jamiat-a-ul-Tulba Violence has occurred in Allahabad Rudauli Bara Banki Varanasi Musafirkhana Sultanpur Lakhimpur-Kheri Dumariyaganj Basti Sambhal Meerut Neuria Pilibhit Shahjahanpur Bahraich Beejpur Jaunpur Moradabad and Azamgarh Indecision on the part of the government is to be blamed for allowing such situations to arise The latest clashes in Faizabad or the rising tempers in Kanpur are also the result of either the governments laxity or indifference However the strategy proved fruitless and the governments attitude only resulted in the strengthening of or like the RSS the VHP the Muslim League the Muslim Majlis and their off shoots FOREIGN AID While Hindu and Muslim fanatic organisations accuse each other of receiving foreign money neither are in position to prove or disprove the allegations sometimes ago the Centre had directed the state government to keep vigil on 37 organisations stated to be receiving foreign grants Yet nothing concrete seems to have been done so far The series of events though sporadic in the recent past have further encouraged mischief-mongers to continue with their activities they get away with anything On March 29 two persons were arrested in the state capital hoisting saffron flags in public places on VHP call The Farishad leaders sought the intervention of ministers to get the two released without much delay This encouraged thousands of others to hoist saffron flags atop buildings shops and in public places On March 1 4 fanatic was arrested for setting fire to the holy wood piled up before temple However no sooner than he was caught Muslim activists pressurised the district administration to release him In another recent incident person
