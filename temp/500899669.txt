Rumours of Mr Shamimi death 4 were rife even before the event They had proved so convincing that language news agency had sent out news flash which had to be subsequently retracted but not before. Delhi-based newspaper had carried the news The district Mr Bagla agrees that rumours are preventing the restoration of harmony But even he cannot say how far the rumours are being caused by genuine. panic among the people and how far they are being planted by agents provocateurs series of stray incidents from the end of August including four stabbings leading to two deaths providing the backdrop.

relatives and friends by the other section The district authorities asked for list of names of the missing persons checked up and found them to be completely untrue Most of those declared missing had

Muslim attached to the Shanti Xunj rf VVV LAW MUST TAKE COURSE two-man committee was constituted iron out the differences be-i tween the supporters of the two akharas The citizens council also felt that the two incidents of September 13 were with each other arid that the law should be allowed to take its course At this stage the district magistrate Mr Bagla proceeded oil leave to The Jrirya of his father who had died on September 5 on September 15 Kachermala was stabbed while returning home from his shop in Osmanpura which is furlong away from his house in Bawrimandi He died the next day after his dying declaration he is said to have identified the assailants as belonging to the minority community with the growing awareness of something brewing the district authorities swung into action with riot-control scheme wave of pre and the introduction of mini curfew followed Kachermals Places of public amusement and gathering like cinemas pan shops and restaurants were ordered to be closed at 9 pm Between September 16 and 23 almost 250 known bad characters were rounded up These persons are still in custody As the situation appeared to improve the mini curfew was gradually relaxed to the extent of allowing public places to remain open till midnight On October 3 Suresh Bhura said to be dated and part-time wrestler was stabbed Bhura was attending charity show in local theatre organised by the city's chemists and druggists in aid of flood victims He was reportedly called out by three persons known to him on the pretext of eating pan Since there was police picket near the pan shop Bhura was taken short distance away and stabbed He died on October 5 DYING DECLARATION In his dying he had named his alleged killers Habib Azad and Anwar the latter Two being part-time wrestlers The seriously injured Bhura was admitted in ward 2 surgical of the Malkhan Singh district hospital on the fringe of the old city close to the densely populated Russslganj areas named after some long forgotten colonial magistrate From the very beginning Bhura relatives and friends had kept vigil in the corridor outside the ward As his condition deteriorated more more people including suspicious charges clogging the hospital corridors As Bhuras death appeared imminent the district authorities initiated steps to prevent major outbreak of trouble police platoon was posted in the hospital Also stationed were four officials the additional district magistrate city the superintendent of police city magistrate and DSP Intensive patrolling was again resumed all over the city CLAMOUR FOR BODY Bhura died at 235 pm on October 5 There was an immediate clamour for his body which could not be legally handed over to anyone without post-mortem which is compulsory in all such cases And yet despite elaborate time by the police the body was placed on and taken out of the hospital in broad daylight at the head of 400-strong procession Chanting inflammatory slogans like Khoon ka badla khoon se lenge the procession moved rapidly through the crowd of the old city Significantly the procession did not go to Bhuras house in the Delhi Darwaza area Instead it headed straight for Chauraha Abdul Karim locality populated almost entirely by the community On the way thugs pulled down sun-shades outside shops and roughed up some members of the minority community The professor called upon ers belonging to the majority community to close their shops and start avenging Bhuras death By the time Bhuras body was laid at the crossroads vandals had begun systematic campaign of destruction shops and bakeries were looted and set on fire Meantime the body was spirited away by relatives and friends andtaken for the last rites The rioting and looting escalated and spread to the neighbouring areas Shopkeepers and bakers at Chauraha Abdul Karim fled leaving their unlocked shops to the mercy of the rioters Manalc Chowk of Aligarh is away from Chauraha Abdul Karim The two places are separated by long and winding street lined with shops of goldsmiths and sweetmeat sellers And yet rioting broke out in Manak Chowk quite ghastly goings-on at Chauraha Abdul Karim Indeed it is alleged that the arson and looting at Chauraha Abdul Karim was only diversionary tactic to keep the police busy while Manak Chowk was the real target of the trouble-makers This seems valid conclusion because the worst destruction had taken place at Manak Chowk and the neighbouring areas from where 10 of the 11 bodies were recovered immediately after. The riot The district administration is convinced that Bhuras unauthorised funeral procession is the root cause of the riot The question then arises as to how the body was allowed to be removed from the hospital under the very nose of the senior officials posted at the spot to prevent precisely1 that The district magistrate Mr Bagla candidly confesses An error of judgment may have occurred Explanations have been sought EXCITED MOB According to some doctors no fewer than 400 persons were in the hospital corridors when Bhura died technically however the hospital was then closed for the afternoon and only the doctor on emergency duty was present He felt that there was little he could do to pacify the excited mob The SP city summoned from the Kotwali by phone arrived 10 minutes later and was immediately surrounded by the dead mans relatives and associates They demanded that the body be handed over to them without post-mortem as it had already suffered enough indignities The SP had explained the legal position and had reportedly convinced the relatives that their case for compensation would be considerably weakened if no autopsy was performed. He promised to hand over the body within 18 minutes The SP had to inform his superiors of the grim development But the telephone in the emergency ward was out of order So he went to another phone down the corridor strangely enough the other three officials followed him to the telephone rather than stay in the emergency ward Seizing this opportunity section of the mourners invaded the ward took possession of the body and briskly. walked out with it while the picket looked on indifferently The SP and other officials returning from the telephone discovered what had happened only when the tail-end of the procession was disappearing round the bend The seizure of the body had apparently non-plussed the four officials The first to recover the shock was the SP city even though he was unarmed arid unfamiliar with Aligarh to happen Condoned on Page 18 Column 6 bullet hole in the wall of house in Aligarh the result of the pots on October 5 TOI photograph Magistrate is hurt barrage of brickbats Continued from Page 17 Column 6 having been transferred to this town only month earlier To make matters worse he was also without his wireless-equipped vehicle He ran hard asking the processionists to stop but discovered to his dismay that he was utterly alone confronting an inflamed mob Neither the police picket at the hospital nor the other three officials had cared to follow him to his relief the SP spotted patrol led by circle officers ffe immediately sought their assistance But they inexplicably failed to The SP then ordered the circle officer to stop the procession But the patrol obeyed this order go as to let the procession get iway to Chauraha Abdul Karim The district magistrate Mr Bagla and the SSP Mr Prasad reached Chauraha Abdul Karim with large police force toon after the DM was among those injured in the brickbats Finding the situation rapidly going out jf control he ordered the imposition of curfew which had been announced and the loudspeaker But the din was so loud tha the announcement could we be heard The DM then ordered the police to fire on the mob front the roof of the Kotwall The rioting and arson continued unabated spirit shop in the centre of the market near the Kotwali was forcibly opened by the DM as it had been the scene of major conflagration in the 1971 riots The inflammable material had hurt the Kotwali shop suspected to contain ers had also been forced open but it was empty In all 23 shops and about 50 houses have been destroyed according to official figures The DM says 71 bodies had been recovered immediately after the riots which only one had gun wounds All others had stab injuries Non-official estimates of those put to death by the rioting mob and of the casualties in the firing are much higher There seems no dearth of firearms both licit and illicit in Aligarb One of the worst affected areas in the vicinity of Manak Chowk is called for some reason Bene Israel mohalla Its residents allege that they saw number of private citizens firing on the mob from the rooftops Bullet-scarred walls even in nearby testimony to the fury of the firing CRP jawan belonging to the minority community who had come to visit relatives in the Bene Israel is quoted as having said that three strangers had been shot dead near his house carried away by the PAC late at night and cremated WATCHFUL EYE The 12 companies of police in the district. on the day of the riots were spread rather thinly all around Some were posted in the rural areas to keep watchful eye on the Dasara celebrations Others were detailed for duty for the Kali procession scheduled to take place in the town proper on the day of the riot The imposition of -curfew was followed by wave of arrests including that of Bhuras brother against whom case of tampering with evidence he is one of the persons to have spirited away his brother's body from the hospital has been registered watchful eye was kept on the situation and the curfew was gradually relaxed during the succeeding days until Mr Shamim's death on Monday Whether this will mean any change in the earlier decision to reopen the primary schools cannot be said But colleges and other institutions of higher learning considered to be flash points for renewed trouble are to remain closed immediately This is bound to mean postponement of the examinations Political leaders of all hues have been Booking Aligarh to study the situation and blame Among the notables who had visited so far are Mr Krishan Kant MP who headed three man Janata Party fact finding team The UP chief minister and three of his ministerial colleagues the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Delhi and Mr Khurshid Alam Khan MP leading Congress mission and the irrepressible Mr Raj Nar in apart from exchanging their remarks with one another and demanding judicial probe into the riot they have achieved precious little To be concluded
