Ayodhya To Idgah Emotions As Political Weapon By AMULYA GANGULI SINCE Ram failed to serve the BJPs electoral purpose in last November's elections the party seems to have turned to the national tricolour for succour The place it chose to flaunt its patriotic credit was the Idgah maidan in Hubli Karnataka previously unknown piece of disputed property which the BJP hopes and its oppfear will become the Ayodhya of the south Just as the sangh scouts claim to have located 3000 mosques built on the ruins of destroyed temples the site in Hubli must have been selected with considerable care It met certain conditions which the BJP presumed would be of no little help for its propaganda purposes For the land is under litigation which means that it is largely unguarded since it is claimed by more than one party The other and more important condition is that one of the disputants is Muslim organisation This means that it will feel jittery whenever the BJP announces its intention to descend en masse on the site As result the administration will have to intervene helping the BJP to proclaim that it was prevented from performing its patriotic duty of hoisting the national flag Muslim-appeasing government and the Muslims the potential fifth column of Golwalkar and the -snakes of Hedgewar Uncertain Exercise The flaw in this otherwise neat scenario is that playing with basic instincts can prove to be an uncertain exercise Of all the parties none should be more aware of this danger than the BJP and yet it seems to rush in where the angels fear to treat the manner in which the Ram temple issue has been hijacked by the Congress should have given it enough warning In fact the appof by the ruling party at the Centre has been not dissimilar from the usurpation of the Mandal formula by parties and individuals other than the Janata Dal and Mr VP Singh Just as the latter seeks solace from the fact that his cause has won even if he has been marginalized the BJP too will have to look for comfort from the building of the temple even if the task is undertaken by people other than those belonging to the sangh parivar The reason why such daylight robberies take place is that in politics the winner takes all For instance after the success of Indira Gandhi's party in Jammu in the 1983 elections Mr KR Malkani wrote that the BJP candidates may have been defeated by the BJP platform has won Ideas more important than seats as the Hindus of Jammu saw it the BJP could at best sit in the opposition and articulate grievances But the Congress could come to power and redress grievances If Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mr Sitaram Kesari are today championing the cause of Mandal while Mr VP Singh's party is falling apart it is because those with stake in the formula perceive the former to be in better position to implement it than the original hero More Advantageous Similarly in the battle for the hearts and minds of the Hindu religious leaders the Congress is in more advantageous position than the BJP Like the Janata Dal the BJP can never hope to attain power at the Centre while the Congress still remains even in its dotage the natural party of power at the Centre The sants and know this hence the sidelining of the VHP Like Ayodhya the patriotic card can also slip out of the BJP's hands if the Narasimha Rao government decides on tough line against Pakistan Little wonder that the Prime Minister's rhetorical threat to recover Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is said to have unnerved the BJP. It may be recalled in this context how Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee hailed Indira Gandhi as Goddess Durga after the 1971 dismemberment of Pakistan party which tends to bank solely on emotional gimmicks is always in danger of having its clothes stolen by resourceful and even more cynical opponent The liberalisation plank for instance is now the Congress although it used to be the BJP which favoured private enterprise and was perceived to be pro-American when the Congress was pro-public sector and pro-Soviet but even if the BJP returns to the periphery of Indian politics from which it so suddenly emerged it will still leave behind two unfortunate legacies. will be India's first political temple Whoever builds it it will always be seen in Ayodhya and outside more as symbol of confrontational politics than of soothing spiritualism and be an affront to at least 12 per cent of Indian citizens something which7 has not happened in modern times and would have been unthinkable only ten years ago when the BJP had two seats in Parliament The other legacy will be the stipulation against the construction of mosque within specified area in Ayodhya More than the political temple this prohibition is clearly against Hindu and Indian tradition Just as Indians live cheek by jowl as visit to the main street of any mosquito town will show places of worship also abut on one another 1 Temples mosques gurdwaras churches synagogues have always been within hailing distance and 1 more often than not right next to 1 one another In fact they can even look alike with the result that as Geoffrey Moorhouse records in Om An Indian Pilgrimage when the good Roman Catholic Vasco da Gama reached Calicut in 1498 he mistook temple for church statue of Kali for one of Virgin Mary and solemnly knelt to say his prayers in front of it When the VHP argues that since no temples are allowed in Mecca no mosques will be allowed in Ayodhya it is demonstrating curious preference for tradition that is alien to Hinduism To that extent it is pseudo-Hindu indeed pathetic. imitation of the custom of religious community which the VHP never tires of denigrating Given the simplistic level however at which the sangh private operates and the muscular religiosity that it favours it is hardly surprising that its members have not only not seen anything wrong in this unfortunate deviation from the tolerant traditions of one of the most noble and eclectic of religions but also seem to be proud of flaunting what is essentially rigid Semitic concept Splendid Isolation Since its current policies have earned for the BJP position of splendid isolation third legacy may leave behind and which will not be unfortunate so far as the Congress is concerned is permanent weakening of the opposition at the Centre On the two occasions when the Congress was defeated at the national level the entire opposition had formed united front with the BJP as crucial member which had kept its hawkish communalism under wraps Such front no longer seems feasible which means that repetition of 1977 and 1989 is unlikely This does not portend well for Indian democracy What 1977 ensured was to make the Congress shun the fascist course it had pursued between June 1975 and March. 1977 The year 1989 also proved mat cavalier attitude towards corruption carried heavy political price The removal of such threats can have harmful consequences for the future of democracy It is riot. easy to decide which is the bigger damage which the BJP has caused the injection of communalism in public life or the splintering of the opposition to the Congress.
