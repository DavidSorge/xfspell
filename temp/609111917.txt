Cops accused of targeting Muslims By RAJDEEP SARDESAI AND NARESH FERNANDES The Times of India News Service BOMBAY December 10 ON side-street in Hharatnagar slum colony near Bandra Ms Nasreen Khan schoolteacher sobs tearfully They are firing at innocent people This is not Hindu-Muslim not but policeMuslim riot Sitting in his plush police commissioners office Mr Bapal replies There is no question of the police targeting any community police officer knows no religion when in uniform adding a proud of the achievement of the Bombay police in controlling volatile situation at great personal risk But travelling through the riothic areas of the city one gets the distinct impression that the police commissioners self-congratulatory tone was slightly hollow ring to it The antagonism against the police is running strong in many places There are three basic allegations being made against the men in uniform Firstly the police are being accused of being trigger-happy Statistics would appear to bear this out Of the 1 38 persons dead so far more than 90 per cent have died in police firing But Mr Bapal argues If the police had not fired on the first day the number of deaths in group clashes would have been many more The allegation is being made most emphatically in the Mohammed Ali Road-Nagpada area where the police had resorted to firing a mob on Monday morning No warning was given no tear-gas shells were burst The police commissioner claims the situation in this area was so tense that the police had no choice but to resort to firing to control the mob Says Mr Bapt Tear- gas and cane charges would have been of little use in such an explosive situation Besides the policemen were in danger of being attacked with choppers by the mob It is true that the police beat houses have come in for heavy attacks The shells at Shaukat Ali Road and near Falkland Street that have levelled the police there bear testimony to this Indeed on the first day of the rioting the police appeared to be the target of mob ire in many places In Padmanagar slum colony in Deonar policeman guarding temple that was later burnt was hacked to death by mob Abdul Sattar butcher from Bharatnagar provides an explanation as to why the police were targeted The security forces only stood by and watched the masjid being demolished in Ayodhya so we decided to get them he says But even if the firing was inevitable in many places there must be questions raised as to the manner in which the firing look placed When the police fired they shot straight at the abdomen and not at the feet says Mr Continued on Page 13# Cops accused of targeting Muslims Continued from Page 1# Lokhandwala municipal corporator from Dongri doctor at JJ Hospital expressed surprise at how few persons he attended had leg injuries The second allegation being levelled against the police is that they targeted members of particular community Again statistics would appear to bear out such an accusation in Dharavi of the 26 people killed so far in police firing 1 6 were Muslims Of the 26 deaths reported at Shatabdi Hospital in Donar the majority were Muslims In Bharatnagar all 13 people shot were Muslims In JJ Hospital of the 32 deaths reported nearly all are Muslims Even police officials admit that more than 90 per cent of those killed in police firing are Muslims But as Mr Vinod Sharma an inspector in Dharavi puts it statistics can be deceptive He points out that majority of the persons who have been agitating on the streets over the last 72 hours have been Muslims In such situations it is usually the aggressor who becomes the target Such an explanation however is not justified in every case For instance in the Bharatnagar area stone-throwing was indulged in by people from both communities on Tuesday yet it appears to be that the minorities have suffered much more in police firing In Mahim too it appears that both groups provoked each other yet the casualties in the police firing have all. Ben Muslims Says Jumai Ahmed bank clerk We were chucking bottles to protect ourselves from mob on the other side of the street But the police opened fire only on us The third allegation being levelled against the police is that after the initial mob fury subsided they have begun entering the homes of innocent people and beating them In Bainganwadi another slum pocket in Deonard the police arc being accused of beating people to avenge the killing of policeman earlier One man shows bruised back that makes it difficult for him to even get up Inspector Chavan who was patrolling Bainganwadi denies these charges It is not the people who are being attacked but it is the police which is in danger here he says It is difficult to patrol areas like Bainganwadi with its narrow lanes shanties One police officer in the area admits that in mob situations in such areas the police tend to panic and fire at once Indeed some police officers admit that the riots have exposed how inadequately trained and poorly-staffed the city police really are
