Mad chase to trace the dead By MEHER BOMBAY December 18 BOMBAY has returned to normal The nightmare of last week has already been relegated to cocktail conversation as people sigh in relief that Transport is moving that stocks are filling up in shops that they can move around without the fear of being attacked by mobs No such miracle has happened in the riot-affected areas however Black charred debris is all that remains of what till ten days ago was home Several survivors have managed to salvage only the clothes they were wearing But the worst affected are those who have lost their loved ones in the madness Of the 50 casualties that occurred in Deonar alone only 26 had been claimed till Tuesday The rest lie decomposed in hospitals as distraught family members run from pillar post in their efforts to trace them Mohammed Usman Quereshis 18-year-old son Arif was taken away from his home bleeding profusely but still alive The next day the father and brother found his dead body at the ShataMi Hospital As the post-mortem had not yet been done they were not allowed to take it away That was the last time anyone saw Arif For nine days the family has been running between Cooper Hospital JJ Hospital Shatabdi and Rajawadi Hospitals as well as to the police at the Deonar police station they were given ADR nos 131-156 saying that Arif body was among those at the Cooper Hospital The father and brothers went to Cooper only to find Arif was not among them They returned to the police station This life they were asked to describe Arif's height and complexion the clothes he had been wearing whether he had identifiable tatoos or birthmarks After some time they were told body no 134 was Arif Back they went to Cooper to discover that body no 134 had never arrived there It is still missing The anguish of the Quereshi family is being echoed in at least 20 other homes in Deonar alone Five bodies remain unclaimed at the JJ Hospital 23 at Coopers and 6 at the Rajawadi making total of 34 unclaimed bodies in Bombay The hospitals face the problem of not 11 A women that are decomposing to the point of becoming unrecognisable Six bodies from the JJ Hospital morgue have already been disposed off at Naricawadi Byculla It is being assumed that since no one has come to claim they have no relatives in Bombay whereas any reporter visiting Demeets several people ly searching for missing relatives Their one demand is to be able to perform the last rites These people have already been through the harrowing experience of trying to identify their kin among sea of bodies many of which are in highly decomposed state Instead of haphazardly disposing of few at time it would be both humans and pragmatic to announce deadline for claimants after which mass funeral could be arranged mass funeral will arouse an emotional response and there is the fear that passions just beginning to cool will once again reach boiling point However the police commissioner Mr SK Bapat has said that mass funeral will not pose major security problems and that his force is quite equipped to handle it
