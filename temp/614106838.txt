By SAKSENA DURING the last six years communal riots in Hyderabad city have become regular feature All political parties blame one another for these riots which is hardly surprising but an important question that faces us today UdtVipr each communal riots are usually spontaneous outbursts or can they indeed be deliberately organised and ignited Unfortunately they can and such made to order riots are growing in number The vast majority of communal riots in India since 1952 have been the result of general weakening of the law and order machinery in its fight against gondas and criminal elements Some powerful elements have now found that communal riots are excellent means of displaying their muscle and their hold on vote banks and in this way enable them to extract concessions from weak statements and chief ministers This was shown in Bombay recently when well-known smugglers and leaders of the Shiv Sena detained for their part in communal riots were subsequently released presumably as part of an overall political deal Starting Riot To start communal riot it is not necessary that even small minority of Hindus and Muslims should want to fight each other It is enough if one in thousand is willing to indulge in riots In Bombay -this number would be about 8 thousand in Hyderabad it may be about 3 thousand in cities like Ali and Moradabad the number would be just four hundred or so These numbers are enough to start vicious communal riots which may leave trail of several corpses hospitals full of wounded and through the imposition of curlew totally disrupt industry and commerce If political leaders of any party command the allegiance of these -goondas and Inany chief ministers exchief ministers leaders of Opposition and big bosses of political parties do have such following and if they are willing to spend few million rupees chicken feed for most of them riot can fee instigatedOur cities are full of slums alleys bye-lanes where no police patrol is visible. In these lanes few Hindus and Muslims have proven to be stabbed by paid goondas and the rest The stabbed will run to their homes crying and full-scale will be called Before the police intervenes the goondas can implement their own riot-scheme namely to loot valuables from shops they can always stop their -operations after two or three days If para-military forces are deployed in strength But the manipulators would have achieved their objective All this means that to some extent we are at the mercy of politicians and their band of goods But looking at the other side it is also a source of optimism that 998 out of thousands Hindus and Muslims do not want to fight or kill each other After all of Hindus and Muslims live side by side without there being any riots If the apparent causes of big riotswoman of one community being molested by the male of another community of different communities fighting each other religious processions being disturbed were the real causes we should be in state of perpetual civil war Hundreds of such incidents take place without any escalation into riots Ifis communal riot in any city in India CRPF BSF and other army battalions -can move in within 24 hours The names of local trouble-makers are invariably known to the police It just needs chief minister totally free from political bias to get few hundred people small cities and lew thousand people in Hyderabad or Bombay or other big towns rounded up and sent to jails preferably outside the city Once this is done communalriot will collapse like punctured balloon Riots occur because police chiefs have to follow certain political guidelines in making arrests These exclude arrests of goondas e-r longing to the chief ministers party City police chiefs constantly get phone calls from ministers in the capital which relates mostly to release of goondas close to these leaders even before independence the city of the law and order machinery to deal with communal riots depend ed mainly upon the strength and the will of the persons dealing with the situation When the government was not interested the responsibility rested on the district magistrate and the superintendent of police who had to show the necessary determination former director of the NPA now retired Mr Misra gives the following account of such situations When everybody was assembled Micky entered the hall and ordered the doors to fcs closed and bolted from inside then harangued the local leaders pt about quarter of an hour using every epithet and abuse in his lary and accused them of being lonely responsible for all t trouble in the city Before they could say anything in defence he directed the superintendent of police to have them arrested and sent to jail The leaders were nonplussed and completely founded at this disastrous turn of events Some of them stood up in speak in their own defense but Micky refused to listen to them Jealisins that the collector meant business and knowing his past reputation they jivone voice asked for forgiveness and for mercy When Micky was satisfied that they were genuinely and would create no further trouble he agreed to let them off voice they signed previously prepared agreement This document was in the nature of an unconditional apology for their past misdeeds and premise to maintain nearly in the future Despite the nity they suffered they were happy at this small gesture of -ness on the part of the collector Thz were even elated at the possibility pL being saved the ignominy of jail confinement They gladly signed this agreement without reading its tents and breathed great sigh irelief when they found themselves free to go home The impact of this highly unconventional approach to the Drflbiem was tremendous and peace prevailed in the city thereafter As long as Micky stayed the district as collector no trouble -- of any kind took place Moral Fibre The National Security Act and section 153A of the Indian Penal Cotter state governments legal powers to emulate the example of Micky if they want to The real difficulty is that they neither the will nor the moral fibre to arrest trouble-making to some extent themselves of with such criminal dements They can arrest goods longing to other parties But such one sided arrests only aggravate the situation These leaders with their money and their captive vote banks will become more and more important with the approach of the Lok Sabha elections In Hyderabad recently Mr Bhaskara Kaq has usurped the chief ministership released from detention number of persons arrested in connection with pxt various riots In such tions is it any surprise that the prospects for checking communal riots irt the future is becoming bleaker as we have more and more riots made to order
