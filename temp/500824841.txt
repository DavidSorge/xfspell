By KIRPEKAR AND SEN SAMBHAL April 6 VARIETY of circumstances appear to have conspired to escalate an ordinary brawl into riot that communal left in its wake 25 shops burnt and 16 people dead indeed is not correct to describe the arson loot and murder that took place on March 29 as communal riot The tragic events could more appropriately be used to the work of anti-social elements or goondas who decided to act at the behest of local trouble-maker to exploit religious sentiments and pockets of discontent to fulfil his political ambitions There is little to suggest that communal tension prevailed immediately before March 29 in this historic town in Moradabad district which was once the capital of Prithviraj Chauhan and which boasts of over hundred temples and an equal number of mosques Of its population of lakh 75 per cent are Muslims and the rest Hindus That the bulk of the population from both the communities stayed away from violence on that fateful day is one encouraging indication of the general desire to maintain communal harmony The fact of their non-participation in the orgy of violence also demolishes the general notion that members of the two communities were out for each others blood survey of the riot-torn town by this team of reporters corroborated this impression that only very small number of people indulged in violence Not one single residential area was rocked by violence This is significant considering that members of the two communities live cheek by jowl in adjacent colonies separated by narrow winding lanes so narrow that one can almost shake hands across them The four hours of frenzy that afternoon was confined to the Market Road right from the tehsil office down to the khandsari unit where bloodthirsty mob burnt six people alive mobsters could not have numbered more than 1000 at any stage It is quite likely from what one heard here from different sources ft that there were three mobs on the rampage These mobs dominated by goondas burnt shops some selectively others collectively What cannot be ruled out is the presence of hardcore elements from the two communities in these mobs Another important factor that points to the general desire for communal peace on both the sides is the manner in which the people here react to provocation It might be recalled that on February 29, 1976 when the 65-year-old Pesh Imam of the Jama Masjid here was found murdered the response was not an extremely violent one There were cases of arson and curfew had to be imposed but it was relaxed quickly and lifted speedily as normalcy. returned with the arrest of the culprit If Sambhal had not burnt itself out in 1976 in the face of what easily was grave provocation it is not in keeping with its character to over-react to trivial incident in which the -maker demanded that shops be closed Resistance to this demand proved to be the flashpoint Yet in retrospect one would think that prompt action on the part of the police and the local administration could have singularly averted the tragic incidents that followed But events happened in an altogether different and unexpected way and few had any inkling of the dark shadow was to be cast on Sambhal Although prohibitory orders under section 144 Cr had been imposed around the tehsil building the police allowed Ujo demonstrations to take place One was led by Mr Raggan Lai. of the Congress-I and the other by Mr Manzar Shan an ex-Muslim League leader who has unsuccessfully contested elections to the Lok Sabha and the UP assembly Mr Shaft who is in his early thirties was leading group of cycle-rickshaw-pullers to the sub-divisional magistrate to demand the repavement of tutted streets What appears to have annoyed Mr Shafi is that the SDM asked him to wait while he parleyed with the Congress-I deputation who had arrived first to meet him His vanity hurt Continued on Page 14 Column 6 Sambhal rioting class war Continued from Page 1 Column 5 an irate Mr Shaft reportedly gave call for general hartal By all accounts it seems that the cyclerickshaw-pullers slogans and rushed down the slopes to the main bazaar where they asked the shopkeepers to down their Shutters Some anti-Bania slogans were also raised by the agitators An altercation the ofa stationery shop of Nand Kishore and Sons and section of the rioters sparked off confrontation when it refused to close his shop At this stage some mobsters are reported to have broken off from the main group of about 200 into the nearby Subzimandi and looted vegetable sellers This was the signal in the looting spree to begin third mob moved towards the and set fire to shops right under the nose of the police This mob is alleged to have been led by printing press who prints Congress-1 literature It is said this mob could not have indulged in arson without police connivance if riot protection The breakaway mob which appears to be leaderless Mr Shan having been arrested by now had simultaneously gone on rampage down the street to the end of Nakasa where the khandsari unit owned by Mr Banwari Lai Gel was brutally attacked The weekly haat bazar was on and some of the people here rushed into the first floor of the nearby khandsari unit to seek refuge on seeing the mob But they were far Lrom safe The mob broke open one of the two gates of this unit with tractor and streamed in It set fire truck parked the courtyard and ransacked the offices which were later set to the torch Some mobsters went upstairs where they asked the terrified people to emerge one by one Then followed the massacre As they came down singly they were bludgeoned to death bonfire was lit using the available wooden furniture and the bodies were thrown into it Burnt bone fragments seen by this team of reporters evidence of the barbarous attack According to Mr Orn Prakash Garg of the khandsari unit Mr Banwari Lai Goel who was his maternal uncle had been done to death in the massacre Mr Gobis spectacles were found outside the unit on the road Tlie vehemence with which the khandsari unit was attacked could be attributed according to sources to the general resentment against the more affluent traders of Sambhal who tended to be exploitative The ire was not directed against community as much as it was against certain class Another agonising death was met by provision merchant The unfortunate man was suspended by neck from the pulley beam of well and his feet were weighted with stones The body was found two days in the incident While the Nakasa mob was busy burning looting and killing another mob armed with kerosene cans and flaming torches proceeded towards the Chakki-ka-Path-Wali-Masjid near the market Shops around the mosque were looted and set on fire The mobs were apparently equipped with inflammable material and carried arms both licensed and ed Some shots were also fired Once the violence subsided the politicians moved in Accusations and counter-accusations were made The local politicians gave the episode communal tinge to consolidate their spheres of influence Dr Murli Mariohar Joshi general secretary of the Janata parliamentary party who spent day he described the riot as concerted effort by certain elements to disturb communal harmony in Uttar Pradesh This is all that remains of shop after the recent riots in Sambhal TOI
