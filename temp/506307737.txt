Aligarh revisited--II Aligarh revisitedII city divided against itself By and SEN ALIGARH November 21 ALIGARH is city divided Physically the Taihay track and the Grand Trunk Road are the no mans land between the agony of violence in the old city and the tranquillity of the Civil Lines and university areas Within the old city itself the people are into two along religious lines Further yet Janata party is racked with factionalism disabling it from playing constructive role in soothing the ruffled sentiments and helping to restore peace The communal carnage of October and November also taken its toll of such cohesion as existed in the ranks of the administration No wonder even responsible officers have been squabbling in public and blaming one another In sense even the Civil Lines and the Aligarh Muslim University campus have not been left unaffected by the riots Heated debates take in AMU on the root cause of the trouble and the possible remedies for it. The sheer magnitude of the police presence in the old city the BSF the PAC and the CRP have all been deployed is staggering There are 11 PAC companies and nine companies of the BSF posted in armed clusters all Over the town but mostly in sensitive areas Phool Chauraha Chauraha Abdul Karim Madar Gate Sarai Sultani Sarai Kaba Sarai Miya and Turkman Gate CURFEW RELAXED The curfew is being gradually relaxed by an hour day But even during non-curfew hours the streets bear deserted look Until yesterday most Hindu shops were closed in response to call for hartel by the traders association According to some the response would not have been so overwhelming had the members of the Janata Yuva Morcha and the Vidynrthi Parishad wearing black arm bands not gone around enforcing it However even if the shops were Open this would not have meant restoration of peace For Hindu shopkeepers and Muslim residents neighbours for generations at Phool Chauraha no longer have anything in common to talk about except religion and the carnage in its name Koli blacksmiths and their Muslim locksmith neighbours at Sarai Kaba and Sarai Miya greatly dependent on each other economically are no longer even on talking terms With shops closed either out of fear or because of the hartal hardly anyone ventures out The Hindu shopkeepers take exception to the one-sided attitude of the administration They allege that action is being taken only against the members of the majority community As an example they cite the attachment of the properties of Mr Navman businessman and former president of the local Janata unit This in spite of the fact that he has been evading arrest since warrants Continued on Page 9 Column 1 damaged house in the Sarai Kaba area of Aliearh which was the target of mob fury on November 8 TOI photograph Life in Aligarh totally paralysed Continued from Page 1 Column 4 were issued against him because of his alleged involvement in the October 5 riot According to the administration attachment has followed monthlong investigation by the CID into the incident Mr Navman and court order to the effect that their properties be attached Rumours are rife every day that Mr Navman will make dramatic surrender at the head of procession of his followers The role of Mr Navman and others has led to acute dissensions between the various constituents of the party principally the Jana. Sangh and the BLD The other constituents are lining themselves up behind these two The two ministers in the US government elected to the state legislature from Aligarh are also at loggerheads with each other What one does the other does and the two tarry on war by proxy through their followers The inevitable result is that the party is unable to plan any constructive role though the situation demands an effective initiative from the ruling party The in-fighting within the Janata cannot but have baneful impact on the administration The first casualties of this have been the previous district magistrate Mr Bagla and the former senior superintendent of police Mr Prasad who have been transferred out of the district Not merely the officials but practically all political parties. student organisations and religious groups are bigoted over the replacement of the district magistrate and the SSP Its repercussions according to reliable sources have been felt as far off as Lucknow where the home secretary has proceeded on leave in disgust and requested change of job The transfers and the controversial lifting of the curfew on November 8 at critical juncture leading to ten. deaths seem to be inter-linked with each other It is no longer secret that the decision to lift the curfew was taken by the commissioner Mr Tandon despite the CID's reservations Some Janata leaders such as Mr Shiv Hari Singhal who used to praise Mr Gagla and denounce the PAC have now inexplicably reversed their Stand At the same time some Muslim leaders are openly alleging that men of their community had been singled out as targets of the PAC guns They make particular mention of the death of five Muslims including lame boy in the PAC firing at Sarai Kaba However all this does not explain the manner in which the hitherto uninvolved scheduled castes in Sarai Kaba and Sarai Miya were dragged 1 into the vortex of the most vicious violence Aligarh has seen in October ever in previous years the scheduled castes kept themselves aloof from the recurring communal riots in the university town On the present occasion however, the conclusion is inescapable that the Kolis who are closely linked with their Muslim neighbours in the lockmaking trade were specifically picked for attack According to senior officials business rivalries between the Muslims and upper caste Hindus have played their role in engendering feelings of hatred They have suggested that the riots in the so far unaffected Sarai Kaba and Sarai Miya areas could be partially attributed to this unfortunate factor Aligarh Muslim University has also been cited by many officials included as being a source of unending conflict Mr Singhal sums up one point of view by describing AMU as snakepit of communalism Mr Idyaratan Aggarwal businessman describes it as miniature Pakistan in India Strangely enough this has not deterred him from sending his son to AMU to such hostility the intelligentsia of the minority community has reacted equally sharply Consequently it defends not only the university and its impressive record of scholarship but also some of the indefensible activities of the irresponsible sections of the minority community Thus deprived of any political or civic support the officials have been left to their own devices in the face of an acutely agonising situation It has decided to move away from the traditional concept of district peace committee to the apparently more effective instruments of peace committee for each mohalla To ensure the smooth functioning of the mohalla committees is new district magistrate Mr Deewan and the SSP Mr Saksena have excluded all political elements from them Nor are outsiders allowed on these committees Another ingenious safeguard against the intrusion of rable elements is that the Hindus have been asked to nominate Muslim members and vice versa So far about 20 such committees have been set up The SSP Mr Saksena expressed the hope that these committees would continue to function on permanent basis acting as watchdogs on civic and law and order affairs in the event in normal times Simultaneously the rounding up of anti-social and communal elements as well as the CID investigations are in progress superintendent of the CID from Lucknow is camping at Aligarh So far well over 300 people have been arrested following the fresh outbreak of riot number of people arrested in the course of the previous riots are still securely behind the bars There is widespread belief however that all those arrested are small fry with the bigger fish either in hiding or openly carrying out their nefarious designs Some of the latter elements have been accused of contributing to the tension with irresponsible public utterances particularly during Id-ul-Zuha. All in all life in Aligarh can only be described as almost totally paralysed More than 50 days have elapsed in the ding-dong communal battle Ironically the communal tion has come in the wake of no. less disastrous floods According to rough but reliable estimates the two catastrophes have cost the poor people of Aligarh nearly Rs 5 crores Mr Chintamani Gupta president of the Aligarh Chamber of Commerce computes the loss in the government revenue at Rs 50 lakhs The manufacture of electrical fittings for which Aligarh has been gaining quite reputation annual exports worth Rs 3 crores virtually come to grinding halt Several export orders have been cancelled The growth of industry in the town has led to greater interdependence of the two communities But this now lies shattered The worst affected are the artisans and daily wage earners on both sides of the communal divide They can lead only hand-to-mouth existence even at the best of times Now they are virtually starving Will educational institutions closed trade and commerce at standstill tenuous armistice ceded by rifle-toting policemen and the flames of mutual suspicion burning bright the prospects of lasting peace in Aligarh still seems long way off In fact all eyes are turned anxiously towards the next month which brings with it the observance Moharram Concluded Fragments of band grenades used by rioters in Aligarh recently TOI photographs
