minister added as far as the Vande Mataram issue was concerned Mr Pawar said he had spelt out the governments policy in clear terms He did so unmindful of the possibility that it might adversely affect the election prospects of Mr Kihandwani Cong The feelings of theruling party members were as strong on the subject as of the opposition members Mr Pawar alluded to an interview supposed to have been given by Mr Rajni Patel the BpCC president to an Urdu daily in Bombay on the Vande Mataram issue to which Mr Mhalgi had referred in his speech as soon as he read about it the minister said he had

party had adopted weak-kneed at to appease the anti-national forces in order to the Muslim votes That had already caused lo harm to the interests nation It was necessary he said to put down such anti-national forces with firm hand If the government anthe ruling party failed to do so will not adopt the attitude of on-lookers We shall come to streets and fight the tendencies to protect an preserve Indian democracy and freedom the Jaila Sangh legislator declared Mr Kunte Cong the motion took strong objection the threat held out by Mr Mhalgi It was strange he said that of all people Jana Sartghi like Mr Mhalgi should try to teach the Congressmen nationalism and patriotism and to tell them the need to honour Vande Mana Jana Sangh and the RSS he reminded Mr Mhalgi had taken no part in the freedom struggle Nor did they ever sing Vande Maat RSS rallies Now they had suddenly developed love and respect for that song he statedMr Kunte said that reactionary forces like Jana Sangh and the Muslim League were trying to fan disturbances to distract the people's attention from the real task of fighting poverty and unemployment It was part of their design to frustrate the implementation of the Prime Minister's progressive programmes and policies he added Mrs Mr Gore SP said that it was unfortunate that 25 years after the advent of freedom the climate in the premier industrial city should be vitiated by communal tension She said that as result of this the real problems Jacing the people like rising prices growing mental poverty and housing shortage was relegated to the background and an emotional issue of Vande Ma was made an election issue to rouse communal feelings EMOTIONAL ISSUE Mrs Gore said the economic plight of the Muslim masses was even worse than that of other sections But it had been the attempt of the Muslim League to ensure that -the Muslims did not develop love for the country and that they did not join the main stream of national life She said the roiling party was responsible for this state of affairs The result of the policy was there for all to see It was the Hindu and Muslim communalists who had benefited from the situation. Congress she added Mr Banatwala ML said fascist forces like the Jana Sangh and the Shiy Sena had been let loose against the Muslims They had unleashed reign of terror He alleged that the ruling party and the government were responsible for the death of two innocent Muslims in the brutal firing. He said the electorate had given clear verdict against the forcible imposition of Vande Mataram on the Muslims Mr Banatwala said secular democracy in India was strong enough to teach crushing lessons to the Jana Sangh and the Shiv Sena Mr Pramod Navalkar SS said that it was the congress which was still rest for the growth of the Muslim League and the anti-national tendency it represented If the government failed to deal with that tendency the Shiv Sena would fight it on its own Dr Watkar Cong urged the government to deal firmly with those who refused to respect the national song Such people had no place in this country If such people were in the fold of the congress they should be expelled he demanded Mr Dhondge PWP-SA Mr Dighe Cong and Mr Deshmukh RPI also spoke Earlier the house discussed income budget demands relating to public health raise development and housing
