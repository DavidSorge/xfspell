Games people play The Maharashtra Congress leadership has reacted to the recent riots in Bombay by indulging in yet another round of political musical chairs writes Ambarish Mishra MAHARASHTRA Pradesh Congress Committee MPC president Shiva Deshmukh has never been reporters delight His replies vary from feeble monosyllables delivered while rolling pa in to tiring cliches However Deshmukh dropped his guard long enough to make categorical announcement to The Sunday Times of India last week Take it from me Sudhakarrao Naik is not quitting as the state's chief minister Couldn't this quotable quote be case of wishful thinking No am the president of the state Congress and as such have sufficient competence to say that there is no move to change the state chief minister he added However day later nearly 21 MLAs most of them supporters of defence minister Sharad Pawar and few loyalists launched signature campaigns to requisition meeting of the state Congress Legislature Party CLP to discuss the post-Ayodhya situation and the communal riots in Bombay This is the beginning of the end commented legislator That the blood-curdling communal tragedy in Bombay should be followed by the farce of political musical chairs is typical of the state Congress While the riotravaged metropolis needs helping hand from state administration headed by an effective leadership the ruling party is wracked by groupism and infighting The Congress is in bad shape We will need all our strength and efforts to put our house back in order feels exminister and prominent Congressman Prabhakar Kunte Congressmen are keenly awaiting the outcome of the Congress Working Committee CWC meeting scheduled for tomorrow at Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's residence in New Delhi Political observers feel that the political scenario in Maharashtra will be made clear at the CWC meeting where new equations and combinations with far-reaching consequences are likely to emerge The political scenario will become clear after the CWC meeting states Kripa Shankar Singh the MPCC general secretary The chief minister's detractors feel that their cup of woe is full to the brim Naiks concerted campaign against Pawars staunch supporters he stripped 11 of Pawars supporters of their ministerial portfolios in one fell swoop in November 1992 had greatly upset the Pawar group Similarly the chief ministers goahead to the Thane police to initiate criminal proceedings under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act against party MLAs such as Pappu Kalani and Hitendra Thakur both said to be close to the defense minister brought laurels to the chief minister in section of the state Conthe party and the media Dut it made Pawars supporters increasingly resentful with his poor handling of the post-Ayodhya riots in Bombay the chief minister has clearly lost ground to his detractors The widespread accusation that the Naik government failed to contain the riots with firm hand is not entirely unfounded These. riots have come as blot on Naiks copy-book admits senior bureaucrat and an admirer of the chief minister While the city's congested by-lanes were set aflame on December 6 the chief minister thought it fit to be headquartered in Nagpur where the state legislative assembly was in session In fact Naik arrived in the city 62 hours after the flare-up began Routine administrative measures such as setting up peace bodies and mohalla committees were not taken up with urgency The chief minister's laid-back approach stood out in stark contrast against Pawars no-nonsense style of working as evidenced clearly during the latter week-long stay in the city during the riots Pawar lost no opportunity to project his image as the numero uno of the state administration In smart PR exercise Pawar held regular meetings with senior state government officials and leading citizens He toured the riot-affected parts of Bombay briefed the Bombay press with unfailing regularity and made frequent appearances on Doordarshan Naik lacks the tact and grit of Sharadrao admits prominent minister However more recent events prove otherwise White Pawar was in Bombay last Saturday polishing up his PR skills the chief minister retreated to Nagpur to chalk out his game-plan to gather conclave of Congress chief ministers in New Delhi next week and muster support for the PM It may be recalled Naik hosted similar jamboree in the capitals Maharashtra Sadan in November last year to upstage Pawar Arjun Singh and others realising fully well that the PM too is facing rough political weather with sizeable section of party-men clamouring for full-fledged meeting of the AH India Congress Committee the Maharashtra chief minister has intertwined his political destiny with that of the PMs Rao and Naik are in trouble and both are clinging to each other in sheer desperation says senior Congressman and former minister On his return from Nagpur Naik held talks with Gujarat chief minister Chimanbhai Patel and the duo is believed to have worked out an alternative NaikPatel bhaiformula in case they are given marching orders by New Delhi The NaikPatel strategy is well summed up by seniors functionary of the MPCC The reasons for which the Congress high command can ask Naik and Patel to go are applicable to the PM too Naik's strategy seems to have worked to his advantage According to reports from New Delhi Jitendra Prasad Raos political adviser has counselled the PM not to dislodge Naik at this juncture Equally alarming two PMs think-tank in New Delhi are reports that human resources minister Arjun Singh is eager to get Naik on his side Singh's recent statement in Bombay that there will not be change of guard in Maharashtra is being viewed with suspicion by the Central leadership Even the Pawar camp is aware that the Naik-PatelSingh troika can prove to be lethal combination for their leader This is why majority of the signatories to the latest petition demanding CLP meeting have begun to make light of their exercise It is routine matter We want the CLP meeting to discuss other issues like rural development and water conservation says Congress MLA Naik has agreed to convene meeting of the legislature party not only to let the elected representatives of the party give vent to their collective ire but also to send out loud and clear message that he is the leader of the CLP and that he is willing to answer the criticism of his ministry It was not for nothing that Pawar counselled his followers to lie until he returned from his official visit to Malaysia Whether or not the CWC allows Naik to stay in office is moot point Maharashtra future hinges on the question of whether or not the ruling party can provide sound leadership and an efficient administrative apparatus to ensure an uninterrupted spell of stability and peace in the state Since 1980 as many as eight chief ministers have been in office and all their tenures have been shortlived and marked by political infighting Says Shivajirao Deshmukh The bad times are over The MPCC will work with determination and solidarity to implement the teachings of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Jyotirao Phule This is followed by lot of hemming and hawing and more cliches That the bloodcurdling communal tragedy in Bombay should be followed by political farce is typical of the state Congress. While the riot-ravaged metropolis needs helping hand from state administration headed by an effective leadership the ruling party is beset by groupism and in-fighting Sudhakar Naik left and PV. Narasimha Rao turning to each other in desperation PM SHIRODKAR Defence minister Sharad Pawar playing power games
