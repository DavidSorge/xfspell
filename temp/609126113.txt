Hindu-Muslim riot although it has increasingly assumed such dimension It is also a serious law-and-order problem in which the instruments of the state be it the Congress government or the police have become the targets of minority community resentment It is this sullen anger which is now being exploited by some to give the situation communal colour through any of the curfewhite Muslim areas and it is the insecurity and the extent of intowards the political class the Prime Minister Mr PV Narasimha Rao in particular that is most striking It even seems that the animus towards the BJP is nothing compared to the sense of betrayal felt when discussing Mr Rao As Mr Azim Memon trader in Bhendi Bazaar puts it We had come to expect something like this from the BJP but we did not ever believe that the Centre would just stand by and watch the mosque being demolished The anger against the Congress is being manifested in various ways Yesterday when former Congress corporator from the Urnarea Mr. Yusuf Zaveri tried to pacify an irate mob he was almost beaten up and chased away in the Govandi-Deonar areas in the eastern suburbs where there is large police presence the slumwellers mainly Indigent Muslims from UP and Bihar are directing their anger against local MLA and housing minister Mr Javed Khan In the last few years Mr Khan has emerged as the most important leader in the area yet some of his constituents do not even want him to enter the place now All politicians are selfish and are never there when you really need them says cynical voice At another spot in Kurla Congress board appealing for peace has been brought down It is probably the act of some miscreants but significantly no one has bothered to put it back up again At various places posters have come up accusing Mr Rao of having murdered secularism resentment against the police is equally omnipresent In Baiganwadi Muslim-dominated slum colony in Deonar rumours are being spread that the police have been pulling out innocent people from their homes The rumours turn out to be unfounded but amidst the fear and fervour truth has become casualty The Urdu press has also come out strongly against the Rao. government and the police action Inquilib the leading Urdu daily in an editorial today headlined Continued on Page 3# naos betrayal rankles most Continued from Page 1# Upper Hand For Fascists accuses the Congress of having joined hands with the BJP and claims that the Rao government is shedding crocodile tears now The other major Urdu daily Urdu Times in an editorial titled Revenge With Ballot Paper also takes the government to task for failing to uphold the rule of law Accusing the Rao government of fooling the Muslim masses it suggests that the best way to take revenge against politicians is through the ballot box While most of the Urdu dailies have condemned the police firing Police bullets have the names of innocent Muslims written on them, says one paper they are all unanimous in advising their readers to exercise restraint and maintain peace But as Mr Fuzail Jaffrey editor of Inquilab says guess not everyone is willing to accept the voice of reason Indeed it is apparent one witnesses group clash in Kurla involving stone-throwing and bottle fights followed by police firing that patience is commodity losing its market in these trying times But amidst the madness there is ray of hope As the afternoon sun beats down on police patrol at the JJ hospital junction restaurant owner brings the cops some tea and biscuits
