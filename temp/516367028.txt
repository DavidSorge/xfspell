Thakurdwar Mr Gopal Shetty photographer on assignment with the news agency Reuters was allegedly attacked and beaten up by the police at Dadar today He was refused permission photograph activity there The police in many places appear to have been reduced to silent spectators Especially at Gilder Land where residents said the constables and officers watched silently frenzied mob hurled petrol bombs at them for over an hour Dalai Estate residents are drawn principally from a single community Queried about the alleged lapses Mr Bapat remarked Once deficiencies have been pointed out we will move to supplement them He added Our senior officers are not merely sitting around tables discussing intellectual problems but are dealing with the situation on the ground The army's role in restoring peace appears to have been lost sight of in morass of legalities At no point it appears did the police today feel so uncertain of the situation as to have to request the army to scatter the mobs But the common complaint of the riot-hit today was that the authorities were far too tardy in responding to their pleas for help at the Real Road fire for instance where 18 fire tankers that had pressed into service the firefighters arrived two hours after the blaze broke out earlier however the fire brigade was occupied rescuing about 100 people trapped in blaze at the Rajdoot Hotel at Cotton Green Also the dilemma of the firemen may be understood from the fact that the narrow access lanes to the buildings on fire allowed the vehicles little scope at the Love Lane fire this evening Byculla has also been brought under curfew today in addition to Dongri Pydhonie VP Road Girgaum Nagpada Bhoiwada Kalachowkie Mahim Dharavi and Jogeshwari These places will continue to stay under curfew from 8 pm today

in these areas have already been trapped in their homes for over two days now and are becoming desperate Many of todays incidents of arson and looting were sparked off in the rumoured attacks on community members in distant parts of the city Bakeries all over the city were target for the mobs as were shoe shops and hardware stores Meanwhile rumours grew wilder and wilder Milk dealers all over the metropolis were driven by desperation in some cases finally to drink the milk themselves to prove to sceptical customers that it had not been poisoned The situation in Jogeshwari in north-west Bombay was compeaceful today but sporadic incidents of stabbing and arson continued The fire brigade was hard pressed and sought the assistance of fire tenders and tankers from Bombay Port Trust Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers RCF and industrial houses Sources said that fire tenders were being summoned from Pune as well to cope up with The situation About 5000 people are reported to have
