By VIKRAM RAO MORADABAD Reporting free India's worst communal riots in Ahmedabad over decade ago heard European newsman quip Oh all over cow The current rouble in Vikram is again over an animal But this time there is difference Unlike in Ahmedabad the trouble in Moradabad did not begin as clash between the Hindus and the Muslims Instead it began as confrontation between the Muslim and the police It is different matter that the IP police force is predominantly Hindu Rioh had not been uncommon in this sensitive eUP town known internationally as brass town for iiexquisite enamelware There was trouble only month ago when wedding party was attacked and the bridegroom assaulted because his party played music on the street where mosque happened to be located Several factors account for the rise in tension in the town the presence of large number of Hajs people who have been to Mecca and Medina on pilgrimage the flow of petroJoliais and the construction of two Mamie universities presence of kite number of refugees from West Pakistan and so on recent development has gone quite unnoticed despite its obvious importance There has been big influx of Muslims from Bangladesh into the town They have come in search of livelihood Then there are the Bihari Muslims who do most of the manual labour including -pulling The Muslim League has become factor in electoral politics area js result of the growing news among the Muslim community of us voting power This development has followed and has been facilitated by the rise of new middle class among the Muslims as result of the spread of education These young men provide pseudo-religious and pseudo-intellectual veneer to the vested interests of the upper class and give expression to the collective fears of the Illiterate Muslim masses as corollary Jumme-ki-hamu Friday congregations have become occasions for explosive speeches These are relayed by electronic amplifiers Officials may not like to admit it but are concerned over the inflow of petro-dollars In fact they wonder whether the current trouble in VJoradabad is not being used to tarnish India's secular image and to wean away the Milslim community from secular political parties they supported during the last Lok Sabha and vidhan sabha elections The proximity of Aligarh and Deoband as well as the Muslim-dominated tehsil of Sambhal have also helped draw Moradabad town into the ono of tension and turmoil hundred thousand devout Muslims gathered at the Jedigah on Eid day on August 13 The maidan with boundaries has the capacity to hold only half of them Several thousand people positioned themselves on the main road and its adjoining ground outside the boundary wall for the prayers It was only after the prayers and during the by the Shahr Imam that there was commotion 1 on the left Hank near HSB college gate because pig had entered the 1 area Some boys shouted has become prayer has been denied commotion But soon the boys vanished Paradoxically the trouble began when the Imam was urging his audience to be kind to animals When asked Dr Naseem Ahmed medical practitioner whose house is separated by common walls from the Continued on Page 15 Column 3 Moradabadarmed town Continued front Page 1 Column 5 Eidgah which key the pig came from he pointed towards the HSB college side Did you see it No 1 only heard someone say it While none of the dozens of Muslim residents of the area who have interviewed could say that they saw the pig Dt Shamim Ahmed Khan president of the parallel UP Muslim League told me he had seen pigs swimming across the nullah behind the Muslim League near the HSB college gate He also saw them coming towards the naWhy did your men not stop or chase the animals away asked him His men do not touch the dirty creatures version given to me by both some Muslims and policemen has it that when the boys watching pig coining towards asked the uniformed PAC men Why do you not stop the animal policeman obviously piqued retorted We are on duly here to help you and not to catch pigs This was the flashpoint for the riot In the area near Eidagh live the Valmikis sect of Harijans who keep pigs It is common sight to see pigs moving round In fact when the Union home minister Giani Zail Singh visited the Eidgah area the camera shots showed pigs moving about But this much can be said for. certain that pig cannot just enter the Eidgah area when hundreds of thousands of people are perching on roads and footpaths during the Eid prayers This leaves hardly any room for even child to enter Mian Liaquat whose car repair shop adjoining the Eidgah told me When squat on the ground here not even an ant can enter the maiden It is so overcrowded If at all pig strayed into the crowd it was at the perinear the Muslim League camp adjoining the HSB college gate The distance between the Eidgah maiden boundary walls and the spot where the pig reportedly appeared was nearly as much as that between Delhis Jama Masjid and the Red Fort or like that between Bombays Azad Maidan and Crawford Market The pulpit of the Eidgah was half kilometre away from the spot dirtied by the straying animal The police has not yet probed the first information report filed by some Muslim Leaguers two days before the Eid-ul-Fitr August 13# with the Murdoch station The FIR said that the Valmiki Harijans had reportedly threatened the Muslim League members that they would see how Eid was celebrated this year Why then did the police not take action Why did it not probe the accuracy or the inaccuracy of the allegation and establish the facts What followed the commotion has been widely reported Fifty-two women and children were crushed in the stampede another 100 people died as a result of police firing private gunshots stabbing armed clashes and arson Moradabad was once Jana Sangh stronghold But during the June assembly elections the Congress candidate former Jamiat leader was elected with the support of both Hindus and Muslims against the Muslim League candidate This did not end the tussle for leadership of the Muslim community between the Congress and the Muslim League This is incidentally one reason why the Congress MLA and Congress Muslim members are as loud in their protest over what has happened as the Muslim League leaders The RSS and the erstwhile Jana Sangh have not. figured at all in the current unrest Though usually accused of fomenting trouble or fishing in troubled waters the RSS has been consistent in the Moradabad trouble This fact has been ated not only by The state intelligence and Congress political workers but also by the Shahr-Imam Dr Kamal Fahim The Muslim League chief Dr Shamim Ahmed Khan however says that the RSS is behind the police excesses against the Muslims visited the trouble spot and found that while every tent including those of the Congress the municipal board and other voluntary agencies had been destroyed the Muslim League tent. was undamaged even on the third day of the riots have taken photograph of the tent The worst-hit tent was that of the Aman Samiti peace committee The police say that they opened fire only after the unruly mob started to throw brickbats and had lynched to the additional district magistrate Mr Singh Mr Singh was personally supervising sanitary work near the Eidgah and was distributing card sweets to the on behalf of the municipal board Violence on such scale must lead to an analysis of Moradabad's general situation The collector told me that the licences for arms issued to date numbered little over 9000 This figure for an adult male population means that there is one weapon to every eleven adults Moreover most of the arms against these licences are bought from the arms markets of West Asia If there are 9000 licensed arms what about the unlicensed countrymade guns These should equal if not exceed the licensed ones That means that every Moradabadi possesses lethal weapon There has hardly been any response to the government notification calling for the surrender of arms The influx of foreign money is delicate issue which it may not be advisable to deal with at present But its sums are and need to be looked into The authorities will not find the task too difficult if they are interested There is growing fear among the residents of Moradabad and the areas in its vicinity that an assiduous attempt is being made by certain interested elements to make Moradabad Aligarh Badayun and Shahjahanpur areas the Muslim League sphere of influence This is dangerous portential secular forces in western UP where both the Lok Dal and the Congress have been claiming the leadership of the Muslims The member of the Lok Sabha from Moradabad is Lok Dal Muslim while the local member of the state vidhan sabha belongs to the Congress Unless the political workers having faith in secularism wake up western UP may witness the rise of men like Chaudhury Khaliquzzaman whose great ambition was to project Jawaharlal Nehru as spokesman of only the Hindus and Allama Mashriqi whose Khaksars are still active in Moradabad
