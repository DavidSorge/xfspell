f8B1PfaS UfH Every time there is major flare-up and communal forces embark on their dance there Is an outcry against the failure of intelligence Is there in fact any such failure Can ever communal carnage be attributed to the infirmity of the governments secret eyes and ears by INDER MALHOTRA JUST as there can be no smoke without fire there cannot be any fire without the fuel to sustain it is particularly true of communal conflagration If an inflammable situation is allowed to develop and this also is done with heartbreaking really little incident is enough to light the fuse and cause major explosion When explosive tensions have not been deliberately whipped up even grave provocations cannot cause any havoc It is the duty of the intelligence agencies both central and state. therefore to keep careful watch on communal forces especially in chronic troublespots of which there are more than two dozen in the country Only if LhO government is forewarned can it act decisively to forestall trouble Thus it is that even time there is major flare-up and communal forces embark 01 their death dance there is an outcry against the failure intelligence Such failure then is perhaps often enough But attribute every communal car name to the infirmity of the governments secret eyes and ears not fair The reality is no more complex than that As President Kennedy once said the trouble with an intelligence agency is that while it failure inevitably become headline news it is by its very nature unable to advertise it success In any case how does state government that it was able to avert major riot because of timely from its special branch or the intelligence bureaus nation-wide network Moreoverand this 1 where the rub lies, not begins and snowballs despite detailed intelligence warnings The horrendous holocaust in Moradabad among the worst centres of communal trouble is an instance in point Not only were district authorities specifically warned of the impending trouble Eid day but they could see for themselves the recent sequence of events and their inevitable consequences It is measure of the strength of communal forces in Moradabad that the Congress lost control. of this constituency many many years ago The Congress regained it only in the state assembly election in June The day the polling ended there were clashes in the city which could be labeled political or communal depending on the way one looked at the underlying strife Then on July 24 major fracas took place between Muslims and Harijans in which pigs were unfortunately involved. Some of them belonging to Harijans had allegedly been poisoned With all this foreknowledge however no one could foresee The manner in which trouble was to begin and the gigantic dimensions it was to acquire What exactly what can be usefully discussed only after the judicial inquiry into the outrage has been completed But the painful and complex causes of avoidable butchery arson and loot can perhaps be deduced from past experience when easily foreseeable situations have taken an unimaginably ugly turn Mr No-man For instance during the particularly nasty riots at Aligarh in 1978 when the university town was under continuous curfew for more than two months there was no dearth of intelligence advice to the authorities that certain Mr Navman must be arrested But he was an important local leader of the other ruling party the Janata and no one dared touch him for weeks Eventually however he was taken into custody but only visiting American had taunted the Chief Minister Who is this Mr no-man you are so afraid of In Jamshedpur too tilling has been From there intelligence has been reporting the between crassly communal elements and vested interests including trade union mafia Bu pleas for action against the deadly combination usually fall on deaf ears until it is too late Vested interest in cinema house had lot to do also with the Aligarh riots But it is only fail to add that if such interests did not exist the purveyors of communal venom would have some other excuse And number is increasing alas even within the minority community which has nothing to gain and everything to lose by stoking the fires of communal hatred and bigotry What is worrying the intelligence chiefs today should not be surprised to any perceptive observer of the national scene Kashmir more than any other part of the country has become the focus of attention by standard-bearers of Islamic fundamentalism in West Asia who have been flocking to the valley scattering their abundant oilwealth strengthening the forces out to cut at the roots of not only secularism but also Kashmir's membership of the Indian family Oil Money Elsewhere to the inflammable mixture of oil money and wild rhetoric has buttressed extremist forces within the minority producing the inevitable reaction among the bigots belonging to the majority To cap it all illicit firearms are more easily available in trouble- prone areas than sugar In large parts of UP and Bihar the proportion of licensed to unlawful firearms is believed to be one to eight The number of licensed guns and pistols in Moradabad alone incidentally is 3000
