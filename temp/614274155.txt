Ayodhva according to BBC Following the events in Ayodhya last week practically the entire nation was riveted to the news bulletins on BBC's satellite service Besides creating some confusion among the  Kar Sevaks the BBC coverage has also raised several questions among media watchers writes Meher Pestonii was madness sheer madness it was perfect -Lmaterial for study on mass hysteria said Londonbased photo-journalist Dario Mitidieri on returning from Ayodhya There was no logic in what was happening Passions ants everywhere doing what other people were doing without asking why without. considering the consequences Mitidieri reached Fab-abad on the evening of December 4 to find the city normal Next morning he went with BBC correspondent Mark Tully to Ayodhya where Sadhus and other holy men were finalising arrangements on how to perform symbolic kar seva After the meeting Tully and Milidieri went to the kar sevaks camp The kar sevaks had not been happy with BBC's coverage of events in 1990 which had projected them as right wing explains Mitidieri As soon as Mark was recognised we were surrounded by group chanting BBC Bold hai We heard that BBC was being accused of telecasting false report about kar sevaks being lathi-charged when no such incident had occurred At large meeting of kar sevaks BBC was denounced as liar Shortly afterwards German television crew was attacked and their equipment damaged Mark was really concerned because he hadn't sent in any report about lathi charge London too denied carrying such report Realising that all media personnel might have to bear the brunt of the kar sevaks what he clarified the BBC position with the district magistrate as well as with the leaders of the BJP and VHP who promised to issue denial the next morning Meanwhile London explained that 1990 file clips marked Library Pictures had been telecast while placing the Ayodhya story in broader perspective As most of the Kar Sevaks could neither read English nor follow the commentary they must have misunderstood the visuals No clarification was issued the next morning continues Mitidieri Within five minutes of the mosque being stormed the kar sevaks came after the press The Vis-News personnel and Indian photographers Pablo Bartholomew and Nitin Rai were beaten up and had their camera equipment stolen or smashed One journalist sustained multiple fractures of the leg another lay unconscious for two hours Polish woman reporting for Time magazine was chased by crowd wielding swords till she took refuge with Hindu woman It was such an explosive situation that anything might have happened to us Could all this have been triggered off by misunderstood television clip Or did handful of leaders deliberately misinterpret the clip to incite the mob think the leaders misled the people says Ushabehn Mehta of Gandhi Smarak Nidhi Even if the clip was misunderstood it was their duty to explain that it was an old clip But just because of this we should not think of preventing BBC from transmitting to our country or from depicting the truth It has worldwide reputation for credibility Some restraint may be necessary but restraint does not mean holding back information Having entered the world of transcontinental telecasting with large sections of the population still medieval in its outlook India has to brace itself for more such misunderstood telecasts BBC should also be concerned about such misrepresentation If it beams its programmes to particular country it should be interested in how the people of that country react to them says Pheroza Godrej of Cymroza Art Gallery It would be better to mention the date and year of the clip instead of saying Library Pictures as people almost everywhere can read numerals File copies of clips could also be subtitled or dubbed in the language of the country of origin Simultaneous translations as is done for Yeltsin's Russian speeches can also be extended to other languages There is no doubt that it is we who have to learn to live with satellite communication rather than think of knee-jerk reactions like controlling Or banning transmissions The problem however is larger than just file pictures being misunderstood Jt involves considering how candid visuals may affect emotionally charged crowds and in the case of religious conflicts how to depict damage to religious structures In the least provocative way While describing the misunderstanding as unfortunate and avoidable Justice BakLentin says that Doordarshans coverage was more responsible than BBCs The gory images we saw on BBC may appear attractive to foreign viewers but affect our people who are less sophisticated differently Doordarshan gave us the facts without showing provocative visuals In this highly-charged situation such restraint was around Images that could be considered provocative include those of kar sevaks dancing with swords of the kar sevaks on top of Babri Masjid in great numbers and of the destruction of Hindu temples in Pakistan Such images were likely to inflame one or the other community fuelling passions for confrontation between Hindus and Muslims Riots in predominantly Muslims areas of Bombay are reported to have broken out shortly after the 830 am telecast on Monday morning and cable networks in affected areas went off the air soon afterwards However, the rumour that they were ordered to be cut off by the police has been denied Police sources informally admit that visuals of police in Acjon in Ayodhya made the police targets of mob fury BBC had shown the police lying around in Lents even as kar sevaks were demolishing the mosque While such candid visuals are part of good reporting police sources maintain that they require levels of maturity in the viewer which may be lacking in certain sections of the population We Indians have got used to being over-protected from unpleasant facts but in an age of satellite communication this is no longer possible, says scriptwriter Javed Akhtar With the increasing availability of information from different media truths can no longer be swept under the carpet But the new media does more than just reveal the truth We also have to live with the risk of untruths spoken in live interviews being telecast to millions of viewers Who is Raghu Nandan Dhar of Indian Express He was doing BBC coverage from Bombay and reported ten deaths of mostly Hindus when most of the people who have died in Bombay have been Muslims My question is why did BBC choose an Express reporter to do their coverage when Express is known to follow strong BJP line LK Advani also uttered lie while being interviewed shortly after his arrest continues Akhtar When he was asked whether he regretted the till the 200 deaths that had resulted from his Babri Masjid campaign he replied that when 40 temples were destroyed in Kashmir no one had protested except he and his party This is factually incorrect Forty temples have not been destroyed. in Kashmir The BG Varghese commission was set up to in this claim and on visiting Kashmir it was found that 38 of the 40 temples allegedly destroyed are standing intact One temple has been partially burnt and one is ridden with bullet holes When public figure decides to lie on camera it is virtually impossible to prevent that lie from being heard all over the world Such lie has to be refuted with the same force as the original statement We telephoned BBC immediately after that telecast and sent them copy of the Varghese report says another scriptwriter Shama Zaidi commending BBC's quick response The very next day Advani speech was edited It was also followed by an interview with Salman Khurshid who called Advani liar perfraud on the Constitution of India Though they will never admit it deep in their subconscious the British still have an image of India as nation of medieval fanatics This surface in their reporting from time to time continues Zaidi People watch BBC because Doordarshan has lost its credibility If we had really good national news channel few people would bother about what BBC CNN or any other network was showing An ethical dilemma faces procovering riot- affected areas Far from being intimidated at having their vandalism recorded on camera rioters at Dharavi for one tended to become more aggressive showing off their brutality in the presence of the camera There have been instances of photographers withdrawing from affected areas as their presence was leading to greater violence Candid camera coverage inexposes both brutality and inaction far greater impact than the written word This has led to groups of lumpens who are predominant in any mob as well as the police dissatisfied at having their misdeeds exposed turning their ire against newsmen who are increasingly being attacked in the field In addition to the physical injuries considerable photographic equipment is estimated to have been destroyed at Ayodhya Yet the media carries on reporting courageously
