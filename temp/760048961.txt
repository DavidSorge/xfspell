Riots dim the lights at exhibitions By Monarose Pereira HHE communal carnage that has ravaged the country has disrupted the exhibition industry as it has several others With the peak season November to February being washed out by the disturbances exhibition and ancillary industries are feeling the pinch Participants are piqued and worried Many of them depend heavily on exhibitions and trade fairs to promote their products and services The present situation does not spell prosperity for them According to senior manager of the India Trade Promotion Organization international fairs have not been drastically affected as those in the country However doubts and delays have caused confusion panic and loss of prime time Several Indian participants could not reach overseas venues on time Their visas were not ready as foreign embassies in India were short of staff In India exhibition organisers and promoters have been put to great difficulty For example Mr Ashok Neelkant chief executive of Intel Trade Fairs and Expositions organiser of the Food Tech exhibition had postponed his programme at the Nehru Centre Bombay from January 14-17 to April 15-18 Says Mr Neelkant released spate of advertisements in various publications sent out imprinted literature and now all these have to be redone This means an additional expenditure of about Rs 375 lakhs We do not intend taxing the participants by passing on the extra incidentals and we fear the venture will be loss So much of our profit margin has already been eroded Besides foreign visitors from Africa Middle East who had already arrived for the exhibition have gone back without seeing the show and have incurred substantial expenditure and inconvenience We are not sure if they will come again in. April Venue authorities have been sympathetic according to Mr Milind Tawde of the Nehru Centre and Mr Freddy Phiroz of the World Trade Centre considering the situation prevailing in the country clients will not be charged extra for the new dates Designers are also having their share of migraines Mr Alaric Ferns who runs an agency that designs and fabricates stalls for exhibition observes that other parts of the country have not been affected like Bombay With few exceptions in New Delhi and Bangalore most shows have been held on schedule It is only Bombay that has been badly affected but since the city is an important business centre the situation has severe repercussions Craftsmen involved in ancillary businesses like making plaques banners panels and so on are generally located. in shanty towns and gullies and have stayed away from work Their absenteeism throws these programmes out of gear notes Mr Ferns Fortunately the exhibitions have been postponed Since most of the timber markets in Bombay have been burnt the industry is facing shortage of wood which is an essential component in the design business says Donald Kinny another designer Ms Nazneen Irani and Mr Perine Irani who specialise in visual merchandising have suffered setback in their business Says Ms Irani All our raw stock like display stands racks and other basic material comes from places like Abdul Rehman Street Sutar Galli Bhendi Bazar and Jamulli Mulla Road These are predominantly Muslim localities and the work is typically done by Muslim traders They have not yet opened shop Therefore procuring basic materials is big problem affecting our kind of business all over the country Several exhibitions have been cancelled and for us this means bleak business heavy burden has also fallen on the participants who have invested in the exhibitions and now find their entire business in jeopardy We feel very disabout the present situation says Mr Aspi Pooniwala administration executive of Tristar proposed participants in the gem and jewellery exhibition earlier scheduled for January 16 at the Leela Kempenski hotel Exhibitions and Trade fairs are important tools of communication Here you get first-hand opportunity to know the product and the producer You see the product in working condition All queries or doubts can be clarified on the spot Exhibitions also pave the way for building. rapport between the producer and the purchaser However the political turbulence has pushed the exhibition industry into low gear this season And those who do business at such exhibitions are an anxious lot.
