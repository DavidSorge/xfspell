Gujarat on the crest of crime wave By GAUTAM MEHTA The Times of India News Service AHMEDABAD December 24 AS the year 1990 comes to close the inexorable march of lawlessness in the state has belied all talk of peace-loving Gujarat and has also raised doubts as to whether this will be the shape of things to come in This year Gujarat witnessed prolonged communal frenzy as well as an alarming increase. in crimes against women bootlegging and other offences Already the police force has come to be identified as inefficient corrupt indisciplined and politicised While all these tendencies were further reinforced during the current year the total lack of proand lack-lustre attitude coupled with increasing common the ranks has rendered the Gujarat police impotent against forces of disruption Official records of the police department concede that crime has been on the rise As many as 1200 people were murdered in the state during this year Also 1100 incidents of communal violence claimed. more than 300 lives Over 50000 cases of thefts and 1000 cases of robberies were registered Prohibition has been generously flouted and the police have registered 200000 cases in this regard this year. The number of offenses have gone up from 61764 in 1981 to 76000 this year. But the saddest piece of information is that Gujarat leads the country in bride-burning with an average of six women dying daily due to bums With the Chimanhai Patel ministry coming to power things have worsened While criminals felt confident to carry on their nefarious activities the few honest police officers have been greatly demoralised During the last nine months alone the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues who were indebted to their coalition partners the BJP transferred more than 600 policemen on the basis of recommendations In themselves the transfers would have been insignificant But with the transferred officers miserably failing to handle the law-and-order situation in their areas government does not know what to do with these political appointees Confident that they cannot be touched or removed or even manded these police officers have built their own bastions of lawlessness. The BJP and the VHP have also managed to endear section of people to these officers glaring example of this is the former Bapunagar PI Mr CK Parmar who was transferred from the city to Kutch district. But he managed to get the transfer order changed overnight and was posted again in Bapunagar however his dubious role in the ongoing riots forced the government to heed the request of minority leaders to transfer him Of course the BJPVHP force was quick to organise public protest to safeguard its interest and exploit the situation With Mr Amin no longer in charge of the home department several police officers have lost favour with the new man Mr Prabodhkant Pandya The process of toying with the police force has been the single most important factor for the underworld dons liberties law mere glance at the records of the years crimes conclusively proves that the police force has been caught napping The dry law has been the most abused with nearly 200,000 cases of violations registered during this year The state's prohibition policy has made mockery of the entire police force During the last decade 14 million cases were registered an indication of the extent to which the liquor business is thriving in the state The 200000 cases in 1990 are obviously only the tip of the alcoholic iceberg After the director-general of police Mr BS Nirula took over the prohibition squad was strengthened to firmly deal with violations Though this squad under the leadership of the special IGP law and order Mr PK Datta did its best to stop the steady flow of liquor the liquid has always managed to find its own level It is mainly through the prohibition policy that politicians and ministers nurture indiscipline in the Gujarat police force They use the law to distribute largesse. Another unfortunate aspect of the state of crime is the increase in the number of crimes against women The demon of dowry and family feuds has claimed the lives of more than 3000 women Causes either burns suicides or murder The records of the BJ medical college and NGL municipal college show that at both these places more than 4500 bodies were received for post-mortem out of which about 40 percent were of women who had died in this way Most of them were in the 20 to 30 age group Eighty per cent of them were married and their bodies bore third to fourth degree burns Besides as per the Police records more than 2000 women have attempted to commit suicide on account of domestic problems dowry and the harassment by in-laws during 1989-90 in the state study undertaken by Mrs Kajal Patwa of Jyoti Sangh reveals that in most cases the in-laws are in the better economic strata and had political influence Incidents of rape have also acquired high ranking in the crime catalogue. department During the past three years as many as 500 cases have gone on police record in various parts of the state Of these in 240 cases the victims were below the age of 17 These are just the figures that gone on record but the actual number of cases might be even higher particularly in the rural areas where because of the social stigma the parents do not even lodge complaints Often they suffer in silence because the culprits use political influence and also bribe the police so that proper investigation is not conducted When one talks of the state crime in Gujarat how can the role of the CID crime and railways the most prestigious investigating agency of the state government be forgotten As per the police manual the main functions of this agency are to enact control specialised or professional crime throughout the state But over period of time this organisation has been reduced to doing routine enquiries investigation and many time force for doing in the city and other parts of Ahmedabad district with the result that no serious efforts are made to collect intelligence regarding movements of organized criminals and prevent them from continuing their activities Most of the officers posted in the 0 CID have used this organisation primarily for their own gain and consequently they have not objected to the misuse of this organisation by the successive heads of the department Analysts of the records of officers posted to CID crime in the past five years corroborate this Among the existing lot of officers there are only few who have reached the level of crime good majority of them have been graded only average In the past five years the CID has received 43 officers who have been facing 11 departmental enquiries even in the existing lot at least 11 are facing departmental charges From 1987 to 1990 SPS were transferred eight times 28 inspectors were transferred before completing five years five inspectors within 11 three years six inspectors within two years and eight inspectors in less than a year All these aspects have seriously affected the total efficiency and functioning of the CID crime More than 200 important cases are 9 already pending investigation with it and the investigation of many more important offences in the wake of the current communal violence in the 1 state has been assigned to it But one doubts how justice will ibe done to the cases and how specialized crime will 1 be curbed
