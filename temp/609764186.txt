From Our Own Correspondent CALCUTTA FEBRUARY in West Bengal was difficult month and the with which it was fraught are not yet passed On the whole however the situation here is rather one of tension. and anxiety about what is happening over the border than of any direct threat to local law and order The eyes of the world have been on this distraught State and yet conflicting official pronouncements and well-intended censorship -have produced certain amounts of confusion in other parts of India about the real position here LURID REPORTS At this stage little frankness may do lot of good No doubt there were communal incidents here particularly in Calcutta Rome have been killed houses burned and people made homeless But to imply that the disorder in West Bengal has been on anything like the scale of the trouble in East Pakistan is arrant nonsense while the Jurid reports appearing in the Pakistan Press have been nothing but monstrous lies In the middle of February what trouble there had been almost died out completely but in the last ten days the spreading madness of coming East Bengal led to heightening of feeling in this State It ie pleasant for critics of Dr Roys Government to find something unreservedly good to say for it The West Bengal Administration has earned congratulations for its firm handling of the whole business Dr Roy told cheering House on February 8 while replying to the debate on the Governors Address that could not be tolerated and that he was determined to do everything in his power to protect the minorities He has kept his word That some Muslims have been illustrated some even has been no fault of the Administration strong action has been taken against mischief-makers on every possible occasion It may seem paradoxical to eat that in West Bengal now there is almost no communal feeling except of course on the part of few who have never accepted the ideal of secular State By far the greater part of the population although profoundly disturbed by the news from East Bengal feels hot the least animosity toward Indian Muslims Their indignation is directed wholly at officialdom in Dacca which is apparently powerless or unwilling to put stop to national disgrace In expressions of this indignation Indian Muslims have been able to join wholeheartedWORK FOR REFUGEES The difficulties of the State6 Finance Minister Mr Sarker in presenting his Budget at each time as easily imagined One of the heaviest burdens West Bengal has had to carry in the last two years has been that of refugee rehabilitation and just when it seemed that the problem was being successfully tackled this new outbreak has a shift of population in way that must adversely affect the States economy Perhaps this deunrest in East Bengal will die down but long after the news of violence and disorder has faded from the there will remain the arduous task of absorbing thousands of refugees into useful employment The picture of West Bengals fiscal position that Mr Sarker gave was far from reassuring In the course of his financial review Mr Sarker made the interesting remark that in Bengal in many respects Partition became fully operative last year This is true in the sense that the dismemberment of the country was felt to be bound natural in Bengal that many Bengalis unconsciously ignored it for almost year and half Now the effects of that momentous decision of 1947 are being realised here West Bengal Newsletter Thus there is hope that the present difficulties will pass when Bengal both East and West has made the uncomfortable but inevitable adjustments that the rest of the country has now almost completed The current financial year will end auspiciously enough thanks largely to sizable opening balance Next year however is expected to close with an overall deficit of about Rs 2 crores The State will furthermore owe the Centre nearly Rs 24 crores of which Rs 10 crores are attributable to Partition especially expenditure on refugees The worst part of the matter is that there is no good reason to expect any significant improvement in the States revenues on the contrary, the deep discontent manifested in Communist and communal disorders indicates that the path to recovery will be long and thorny The death of Sarat Chandra Bose on February 20 was loss whose full meaning was best recognised in West Bengal That India had lost in him renowned patriot and great man was clear enough but more important for the welfare of the State there had passed away the one man who was capable of forming and leading vigorous Opposition party which is so urgently needed for the rehabilitation of the Congress itself CORPORATION The State Assembly decided on February 13 to continue the suppression of the Calcutta Corporation until the end of this year Taxpayers were disappointed but on the whole approved the necessity to change the constitution of the muni and hold fresh elections on new basis before restoring autonomy to the Corporation Bill will be introduced in the current session of the Assembly to effect these changes Meanwhile Calcutta residents wait patiently for the day when the governance of India#s largest city will be placed in the people's hands and thenceforth carried on in healthy democratic fashion
