Dharavi strives to regain equilibrium By Bharati Sadasivam BOMBAY January 9 POLITICAL rivalry and settling of personal scores along communal lines contributed to last week's eruption of violence in Dharavi The flare-up which occurred within month of the December riots following Ayodhya events threatens to take as heavy and permanent toll as the loss of lives and property mutual distrust and fear and chasm between communities which have lived together amicably with rare outbreaks of communal strife Given the fact that Dharavi is a hub of flourishing entrepreneurial activity and that prices of land and tenements in this 460-acre city within city are among the highest in Bombay it is economic rather than political or religious factors that have prompted most conflicts and also led to the growth of criminal class But cross-section of the nearly 700000 residents who form mosaic of race castes and tongues who spoke to this correspondent were dismayed and frightened at the new phenomenon of communal divide We never had any communal problems here until the mosque was demolished in Ayodhya said 1 Mr Rajan readymade garment exporter who has lived in the Dharavi transit camp for 20 years Yet he attributed only 25 per cent of the current distance to Hindu-Muslim conflict 50 per cent was due to political rivalry he said and 25 per cent stemmed from the settling of old disputes Dr Azimud articulate young doctor who has grown up in Dharavi used the evocative phrase dilon ki doori distance between hearts to describe the change that he saw coming over the two communities feel this is here to stay whatever the efforts of the police and social workers to bring about normalcy Dr Azimuddin is among those who believe that last week's dis were politically inspired unlike those in December which were outright attacks by one community upon the belief is strengthened by the fact that most of the flare-ups occurred in areas like Palwadi Koliwada and Indianagar strongholds of the Shiv Sena which lost all the municipal seats in Dharavi to the Congress in December entire localities blazed and the incidents were spontaneous outbreaks between two communities said Ms Sushobha Barve social worker with Moral Rearmament who is trying to forge peace initiatives in Dharavi This time there have been individual assaults on person from one community here and on someone from another. community there There seems to be an instigation to provoke to open up different fronts The retaliatory pattern was apparent from the fact that three persons of one community one of whom was identified as Shaukat Ali were attacked following the disappearance of teenager Raju on the night of January 3 Raju who was with friend Nawab remains untraceable and his family and neighbors near the Ganesh temple at Palwadi fear that he may have been killed His elderly father Mr Arunmai Nayakam migrant from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu who came to Dharavi in 1950 stressed that there had never been. strife or enmity between two communities living on either side of the temple In the wake of the December riots representatives from both sides had come together to bring about harmony Even today said that do not want 1000 Rajus to be sacrificed for the sake of my son and that am prepared to revive the peace committee said Mr Nayakam But his lone voice of reason among his Tamil neighbours who say they are angry afraid and unwilling to make the first move for peace This has always been quiet and peaceful locality We are not concerned about what happened in Ayodhya or after said Mr. Swamidasan salesman in soap factory The question now is of this boy who has been taken away We cannot talk of peace until he is given back to us The incident illustrates the extent to which hate. propaganda has made communal problems of what would otherwise have been seen as kidnap case or settling of scores between anti-social elements said the actress Ms Shabana Azmi member of the governors Peace committee formed after the December riots How can people who have lived for years as peaceful neighbours overnight become enemies asked Ms Azmi who visited many areas of Dharavi in the last week and spoke to its residents and political leaders Complicating the volatile situation in Dharavi is the public perception of many political and local leaders as persons with vested interests at best. and criminals at worst who have played no small role in instigating trouble The fact that many of them by virtue of their standing are on the official peace committee has several residents pointed out with disgust made joke of these bodies and rendered them useless at times when they are needed the most The peace committee has become catch-all phrase for all sorts of people from genuine social workers to criminal corporators said Mr Azmi The people's disenchantment with the peace committee has placed the police in quandary The police station in Dharavi as elsewhere has directives from the government to include representatives of all political parties in the area as well as the ward-level peace committees At least three of them are known to have criminal links and can do as much damage. by being on the committees as by being outside them The police now find that the presence of politicians is making several social organisations and ordinary people dissociate themselves from the official peace committees and set up local initiatives Acknowledging that the peace process has received setback Ms Azmi said there was however no need to lose heart The atmosphere is now too fragile. when people have lost their lives and homes to talk of peace What we are doing now is only fire-fighting Mohalla or area committees have to be set up in times of peace to be effective in times of trouble she said When people from all communities meet culturally or socially at least twice week politicians get isolated and genuine leaders emerge who are acceptable to all MWe need peace at any But the gap between the two communities is growing and dont think it will lessen said Dr Shahida Sheikh young doctor The challenge in Dharavis melting pot today is how to restore its lost equilibrium
