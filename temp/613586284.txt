Parties trade charges of communalism The Times of India News Service NFW October 28 WHILE all political parties including the Congress have condemned the growing communal violence in Bihar elsewhere the fact remains that no effective steps have been taken to check it The disturbances which have claimed over SO lives in Bihar alone in the past few days have vitiated the political. atmosphere and will inevitably affect the ensuing elections In UP which accounts for as many as 85 Lok Sabha seats communal conflicts have been breaking out from time to time Nearly 300 incidents resulting in the death of 375 have been reported in the past three years All parties are acutely aware of this reality and have lost no time in proclaiming their faith in secularism and dissociating. themselves from the communal elements The Congress and the opposition have accused each other of playing the communal card for electoral gains The Prime Minister Mr Rajiv Gandhi and other Congress Leaders have blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and its supporters for the mounting communal tension On his return from Bhagalpur where the clashes had already claimed 27 lives by then Mr Gandhi said It is hardly coincidence that issues like shila cow-slaughter ban and Ganga jal puja crop up just before elections every five years The BJP and the Janata Dal have on the other hand charged Congress with instigating communal violence They have alleged that the Congress is contemplating to need riots in many other places before the foundation stone is laid at Ayodhya for the Ram temple on November 9 To take maximum advantage of the situation to further its electoral prospects However charge has been dismissed as preposterous by the Congress The BJP which has come under scathing attacks from the CPM and the CPI has been trying to delink itself from the Ram shila and the November 9 ceremony being organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parts. We have nothing to do with the functions as political party BJP spokesman have been declaring repeatedly The BJP leaders have been harping on their faith in what they describe as positive secularism Mr Sikander 1 Bahkat clarified the other day We do not have two yardsticks for measuring communalism Mr Bakht as well as other leaders deny the charge levelled by the CPM and others that the Ram shila is the main cause of the growing communal. tension at present They point out that they were performed at over two lakh places violence broke out only at about half dozen places Pointing out that the disturbances have occurred only in Congress-ruled states they say that the state governments were either in league with the trouble-makers or incapable of managing the disturbances While the Congress has condemned the Janata Dal stand. vis-avis the BJP as dubious the CPM and the CPI are happy about the clear-cut stand taken by the Janata Dal Both communist parties have been charging the BJP the RSS and the VHP with spreading. communal venom The CPM has repeatedly been warning the Union government of the danger of allowing the VHP to go ahead with its Shila It has charged Congressmen with acting as cheering spectators has called for meeting of the National Integration Council NIC to sort out the explosive issues in co-operation with all political parties Mr Harkishen Singh Sujeet, the CPM politburo member says The consequences of allowing the shilanyas are far-reaching For instance once you permit the foundation stone to be laid can it be removed It will be source of perennial tension The Congress is obviously in dilemma At a meeting held in Lucknow on September 27 in which the Union home minister Mr Buta Singh the chief minister Mr Tiwari and VHP leaders took part the VHP was allowed to proceed with its programme But the conditions laid down like prior of the routes of Ram shila processions to the local authorities obviously did not take into account the explosive nature of the issue as well as the inadequacy of the law and order machinery to deal with possible outbreaks of violence Even if the government now rethe gravity of the situation and wants to ban the shilanyas it might hesitate to do so fearing that it may alienate fairly large section of Hindu voters At the same time communal tension and violence might grow if the programme is allowed to continue creating a sense of insecurity among who incidentally constitute about 1 per cent of the country's population Meanwhile the BJP has demanded the dismissal of the Bihar government saying statement of the Prime Minister Mr Rajiv Gandhi itself corroborated the fact of total breakdown of law and order in the state following communal riots. In statement the party said riots were being staged by the Congress to polarise the state communities and exploit the communal card in the elections The party also accused the Prime Minister of issuing ambivalent statements on the question of the Ram shila procession showing that he was bent on playing the communal card trying to please Hindus one day and KtielifYlC
