indeed even if Bombay is industrially the most advanced city in the country there are several other factors that make it prone to communal conflict These include the continual migration of labour rural to urban areas the overpopulation and consequent growth of shanty towns each of which operates as ghetto rising unemployment and the increasing influence of anti-social elements with 50 per cent of ten million-plus population living in slums sense of urban anomie is easily translated into social discord In this complex scenario the role of the police in controlling the violence leaves much to be desired majority of those killed have died in police firing and reports of indiscriminate firing and the selective targeting of members of particular community are too persistent to be entirely discounted Such dimensions of the frenzy only heighten the insecurity of the minorities It is not just the police who have much to answer for the death toll in Maharashtra being greater than in any other state the entire government apparatus is suffering from credibility crisis Maharashtra has deservedly enjoyed reputation for having socially harmonious policy But now when really put to the test that stable order has shown disturbingly fragile character The chief minister Mr Sudhakar Naik will have to shoulder some of the blame for not having acted swiftly enough in tackling rapidly deteriorating situation Mr Naik after all does hold the home portfolio With some of the worst violence having taken place on the day when the Congress was part of nation-wide bandh it is no use for the chief to accuse the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance of having engineered the riots Indeed while the centre showed few compunctions in arresting Mr Advani and other BJP-VHP leaders Mr Naik has chosen to ignore the blatantly provocative statements being made by the Shiv Sena chief Mr Bal Thackeray arresting him would have at least sent out signal that the government is serious about taking on the cancer of communalism Allowing the problem to fester not only hurts Mr Naik image but also reduces investor confidence in the region Maharashtra is at the vanguard of the country's economic growth and minefield of sectarian violence conveys very discouraging message The fact that Bombay the country's financial capital is severely affected by the Post-Ayodhya rioting as evident from the gruesome death count only exposes the volatile mix of class culture and community that lurks under the seeming cosmopolitanism The events in Ayodhya have only brought these social tensions and communal. passions to the fore with several lumpen elements from both communities taking advantage of the situation to settle old scores and spread hatred Credibility Crisis
