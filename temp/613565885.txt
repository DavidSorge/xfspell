Where were they when the city was burned By RAJDEEP SARDESAI The Times of India News Service BOMBAY December II ON Sunday evening shortly after the Ayodhya incident this reporter rang up leading city politician to solicit his views The man was involved in game of bridge Please dont disturb me now We will talk about it tomorrow he said and hung up There was to be no tomorrow as bloody riots broke out all over the city the next morning For the concerned politician and indeed for the entire political class in the metropolis spreading the message of peace and harmony in an hour of crisis appeared to be bridge loo far The chief minister Mr Sudhakarrao Naik does not agree that the state politicians response to the rioting was delayed think we acted promptly The police acted immediately and the orders to bring in the army were given on Monday itself he said Mr Naik points out that majority of slate politicians were not in Bombay when the riots broke out The Congress MLAs were in Nagpur. attending the assembly session number of senior BJP MLAs were in Ayodhya Most of the MPs were in Delhi attending Parliament Each group claims to have had its own compulsions that prevented them from being in the city Says Mr Naik The session in Nagpur could only conclude on Monday evening because some important financial matters had to be completed Besides there is only one flight out of Nagpur which made it difficult for many politicians to reach the city before Tuesday evening By then the death roll was reaching the three figure mark The MPs also had other pressing matters to deal with Mr. Ram Naik BJP MP from North Bombay and president of the party's city unit is also the BJP deputy chief whip in Parliament With the Parliament session being so stormy just could not get away till Wednes day evening he says Mr Jurudas Kamat Congress MP from Bombay North-East an area which witnessed some of the worst rioting also could not leave Delhi till Wednesday He claimed that he had asked the party high command for permission to leave early because his constituency was burning but was told to stay till the session was over By then the toll was approaching the 150 mark One of the few politicians who was in from Monday was the South Bombay MP and city Congress chief Mr Murli Dora He claims that he visited some of the riot-hit areas in his constituency like Umcrkhadi on Monday itself However his claim is not substantiated by the local Congress workers in the locality He did however keep in touch with the goings on The Bombay North-West MP Mr Sunil Dutt is also believed to have been in constant touch with the police on the phone An inspector in Bharatnagar near Bandra said that Mr Dult rang up every hour He even wanted to visit the area but we advised him that it would not be safe says the inspector Indeed some politicians claim that security risks prevented them from venturing out Like the urban development minister Mr Chhaggan Bhujbal who in 1984 had toured many of the riotstricken areas Apparently Mr Bhujbal's past links with the Shiv Sena was very keen to visit my BycullaMazgaon area but was advised that this might only further include Shiv Sainiks he said Some opposition politicians who were in the city right through preferred to use the rioting to score political points rather than provide healing touch The BJP general secretary Mr Dharmachand Choradia for example issued lengthy press statements calling for the chief minister's dismissal The Janata Dal leader Mr Sharad Rao accused the police of targeting the Muslims The Muslim League also chose to make highly emotional statements as did the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna Nor were there any leaders of the likes of Jawaharlal Nehru who had braved and quietened the rioting mobs during Partition On the first day of rioting only handful of municipal corporators could be spotted helping the injured in hospital and liaising with the local police Some politicians argue that their presence on the rioting site would have only exacerbated the problems Our presence would have only hampered the security arrangements of an already overburdened police force says Mr Bhujbal politicians who did tour the riot-hit areas on the first two days also encountered hostile mobs For example the housing minister Mr Javid Khan was booed by an irate mob near Deonar The fury of the people appear to have finally shaken the political class out of its slumber The chief minister has set up numerous peace committees comprising eminent citizens all over the city The minister of state for horn Mr Babarao Pachpute has been travelling in various riot-affected areas Mr Dora has set up kitchen at the city Congress office to distribute pav-bhaji packets to many of the injured in hospitals He also claims to have been in arranging compensation packages for those who have suffered in the rioting Mr Gurudas Kamat has been paying regular visits to the slum colonies in the eastern suburbs Mr Ram Naik visited some of the families yesterday in South Bombay who have suffered in the rioting The Congress high command has also sent a team of Central observers including Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mr Sushilkumar Shinde to the city But whether these gestures will be enough for the politicians to regain the confidence of the people remains to be seen.
