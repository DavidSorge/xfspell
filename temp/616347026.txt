part of Bihar early this month These refugees are now preoccupied with problems of survival They have little or nothing to fall back upon Answering questions they break down when they talk of their

The main shopping centres are crowded Buses and other vehicles are plying normally But the charred remains of houses and shops in Biharsharif town and adjoining rural areas and the plight of refugees. in relief camps tellingly remind of the communal cainage witnessed here Until fortnight ago inmates of the Nalanda College refugee camp and couple of other relief centres operating in town lived happily in their villages without thought for the future What worries most of these people numbering about 2000 in all now is the problem as to where they would go once the refugee camp ceases function Having seen their houses looted or set on fire their relations stabbed few amongst the refugees now in relief camps want to return to their villages Where would you go then Answering this question the refugees say with one voice they would give up claims to their houses and lands in their villages then return there and live on the edge of fear again The refugees say the government should settle them in colonies and areas where they could feel safe no matter whatever hardships they may have to face at these new places As stated by the chief minister Dr Jagannath Mishra it was for the first time after the partition riots in Bihar that the communal virus spread to rural areas and could not be controlled easily so far the police have recovered from Biharsharif town and

Biharsharif Besides about 15 persons still remain untraced In all 30 companies of CRP BSF and other detachments remained deployed in about 30 villages in Nalanda district Asked to comment on the situation now top level district official said it would be wrong to say that comContinued on Page 7 Column 1 Biharsharif after the frenzy Continued from Page 1 Column 1 Normalcy had returned to the riot-torn areas although people in Biharsharif and rural areas were moving about freely and undercurrents to tension remained and would for quite some time It was wrong to pull out the CRP and units still engaged in peace in the rura and urban areas Ever in Biharsharif people living in localities had not returned to their houses as yet and were afraid to do so in view of what had early this month Even though the fuse to the violence that spread like wild fire ii Nalanda district was lit at the brawl in the Gagandiwan locality Biharsharif on April 30 tension ha been building up in the areas for quite some time owing to over mound claimed by both this majority and minority communities As precautionary measure the dis had set up at th mound police post This post still remains there b nothing has done to the dispute visit to the disputed mound law which -is close both to grave yard and houses of the community revealed that unless this problem was settled to the other communities it might give rise to another violent eruption in future It is puzzling how violence erupted in Biharsharif on April 3# spread to far-flung rural areas of the Nalanda district After cases of rioting stabbing and arson ihs authorities clamped curfew from 5 am or May 1 in Biharsharif It was hoped that with imposition of the curfew the trouble would remain confined to the own But now it appears the curfew

without any land holdings or valuable property They were thought to hz the least victims of anti-social elements Ye they were attacked Similarly ir Gulni Charuswa and other villages or in Biharsharif town the victim very mostly poor people Initially as the trouble spread the state government rushed home guards to protect people in villages threatened mobs But apparently this force was net effective in dealing with the 6 time top official remarked The home guards in Bihar are afraid ever to fire in the air It was too much to expect them to deal with mobs The situation was brought control largely with the help CRP and BSF companies special flown from Delhi for the purpose or rushed from other towns in the state to Biharsharif CRP company was in Biharsharif on the night of April 30 One more company was rushed to the town the same night from Patna Subsequently more companies of this force was withdraw 4 from other towns in the state and detailed for patrolling in Nalanda
