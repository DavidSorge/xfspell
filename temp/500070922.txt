The National Scene Showing Them Their Place By SHAM LAL mHE village of Bangalwa in Bihar Jis only the latest locale The place is different but it is replay of the saint bloody drama each time murderous gang of armed men all drawn from the landed castes descend on village and mow down whole lot of Hajijans with guns What is the provocation Perhaps mere feeling that the Hajijans are getting too big for their boots Or desire to teach them how to keep their traps shut and play dumb in courts of law when they are asked to bear witness in cases impugning their betters The mass killings may be an act of revenge or mere warning The insolent message they carry is much the same in either case The place of the Harijans is at the very bottom of the social ladder in the village it says They want to save their skin they better stay where they are The political scenario which follows is no less sickening than the drama Everyone expresses his sense of horror over the spilling of innocent blood Each party sheds tears for the victims There is a promise of new security measures But what does this mean in society where even the police are infected by the very virus which turns so many members of the so-called higher castes into wild beasts Even if some of the guilty are caught what does not happen very often there is little chance of their being convicted for few villagers dare give evidence against men who have shown how vengeful they can be The hue and cry in the state assembly concerned dies down in due course until the next replay of the drama Issue Exploited What makes the whole thing all the more ghastly is that no politician and no political party foi that matter feels any sense of guilt over the whole community They all exploit the issue to sway Harijan vote this way or that at election time but think it is none of their business to try to change the reality on the ground by sustained work in the rural communities In fact what they do helps to aggravate caste antagonisms All of them pamper the caste lobbies which have lots of electoral pull in many districts Is it any surprise then that the dominant rural castes enjoy far greater political leverage than they did in the pre-indeed Even those who deplore this development do not always realise the extent to which this is the result as Mr Gunnai Myrdal is at some pains to explain of the operation in very poor and inegalitarian society of the political processes themselves Perhaps countervailing force could have been built in the flush of independence if the land reform programme had been pursued with greater vigour arid concerted effort had been made to provide complete security of tenure to the share-croppers and build up associations of poor peasants and landless workers But nothing of this kind was done anywhere except that too somewhat being West Bengal Indeed caste has by now become the only language in which the life of the rural community can be understood in many states society which everyone whether he belongs to the left right or centre Haunts his caste label as part of his personal identity cannot be expected to summon the nerve to wage an all-out war on caste That is why every party even as it decries the -caste system is quick to come to terms with it This explains the new aggressiveness of the dominant castes everywhere They have the run of village scene they have links with the men in power in the state capital They hog most of the gains of development whether it is easier credit higher yields from the land or better prices for the farm produce No party wants to stick its neck out in fighting them because this can be highly risky in terms of loss of electoral support The very pattern of rural growth which has helped the landed castes to acquire new political and economic muscle has also created new tensions in village life The visible increase caste antagonism is only the symptom The source of the disease lies in the political and economic processes which have been at work since independence Spirit Of Violence No one knows how the ruling party proposes to curb the growth of violence in village life The end of the caste war itself has made the old policy of cultivating the support of the dominant as well as the dominated castes increasingly untenable Since the Congress has been able to mobilise large parts of the Harijan vote in every election so far and cannot afford to lose it in any circumstances it cannot suffer the community live in state of permanent terror or new spirit of violence grow among its younger members The question is whether in trying to come to the rescue of the Harijans it will be willing to incur the active hostility of the dominant castes point As things are it is hard to say whether the government has even the means to bring the situation under control in Bihar where members of the civil service and the lower judiciary are also mostly there are drastic limits to what it can do to set things right But even without these limits there is good reason to wonder whether the exigencies of local politics the many shabby compromises of the past and the balance of caste in the party own ranks both in and outside the legislature have not already sapped its will and made it plaything of the very forces it wants to tame In any case some of the corrective measures that are being suggested can only make things worse Thus some well-meaning persons argue that since the government does not have the means to station large police force in every village and cannot in any case count. upon force which casteridden acting with -a saner course will be to give gun licences to Harijan families so that they can defend the community against armed attack in the future The trouble is that few Harijans have either the means to buy arms or even the place to keep them safely and that in case of an armed conflict they are likely to be outgunned and ed by those who have the money as well as the requisite political patronage The aim of the government is to contain violence not gang warfare ruling party which is at all serious about containing the needs of the caste war will have to think in terms of political and economic action designed to redress flie balance of casteist forces in the country But the exigencies of the political situation impose severe constraints on such action The Harijans are not only poor but are often in hopeless minority Their only bargaining counter is their vote which is not of much avail in situation where the dominant rural castes most of the political parties There is no easy way out of this dilemma The cosy-conservative belief that the growth of the rural economy will by itself improve the lot of the Harijans in due course has been undermined by the relentless pressure of population on the one hand and the tensions arising from the sharpening of the contrasts in living standards brought about by the spread of the agricultural technology on the other The radical belief that caste conflict in the countryside is nothing but disguised class war has turned out to be even more wonky because caste antagonists blur or distort the economic perspective and far from speeding up slow down the expected radicalisation of rural politics This is not to say that things can stay where they are for very long The logic of the very processes political and economic which have brought rural life in states like Bihar to the present sorry pass is not going to stop at particular point one fine day It will work itself out and if nothing is done remove the gnawing sense of insecurity which is destroying the very nerve of almost one-fourth of the rural population the result will be not only an alarming increase in rural tensions but an endemic political instability The spectre of instability has indeed already begun to haunt not only Bihar but also some other states and even the ruling party despite just comfortable majority in the assemblies cannot altogether hide its anxiety Lack Of Self-discipline The problem of political management in India which really means keeping the tensions in check is further compounded by the fact that democratic -es work in contrary directions On the one hand they oblige the government to take on more than it can cope with in response to new demands and on the other they render it increasingly difficult for it to impose the necessary social disciplines The utter lack of self-discipline in both the ruling party and the opposition groups makes the situation all the more despairing The growing incidence of violence against the Harijans is by ad means the only source of widespread concern today about the future of the Country The erosion of the integrity of public life the loss of moral authority of those in power to decline in the standard of public debate and the fanatic zeal which all kinds of parochial interests continue to press their demands to the point of subverting the system have indeed made the old joke about functioning anarchy somewhat out-of-date The damned thing does not seem to be functioning any longer
