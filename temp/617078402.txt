But the incident at Kotwali was only the catalyst for full-blown riots Preparations for It had started since the first week of November when illegal arms started flowing into the town Inflammatory pamphlets and video cassettes added fuel to the communal cauldron as did the speeches of Uma Bharati BJP MP during her stormy tour of the Agra division Many people expected riots to take place on December 6 the day the second round of Kar Seva was to take place in Ayodhya The first signs of trouble were evident on December 4 when violent clashes including bomb attacks took place at the Sarai Sultani locality This continued for three nights but the authorities instead of taking action. against the rioters shrugged off the incidents as minor Meanwhile resentment against the police had been growing since November 1 when they opened fire in the Usman Para locality That coupled with other incidents of police high-handedness including the cold-blooded shooting of Harijan youth on November 24 strengthened the impression that the PAC was becoming increasingly trigger-happy Despite the tension the fact that no major incident of violence took place all this while owed a lot to the presence of two seasoned police officers the superintendent of police SP Mr Gurdarshan Singh and the Kotwali circle officer in-charge Mr Rathore Strangely on December 5 two days before things got out of hand Mr Singh was transferred apart from the absence of its SP the town also found itself without fullfledged head on its intelligence unit The post has been vacant for the last six months On December 7

vice-president of the city Congress committee had the police shown little more restraint sloganshouting youths would have diswithout major damage But within half-an-hour all hell seemed to break loose December 8 proved to be the blackest day in the history of the town That night district administration was unable even to salvage the bodies of the dead The toll that day itself crossed 45 Rampaging mobs ruled the streets and the Lucknow-Delhi Goniti Express was attacked in the The heart of the town was supposedly under curfew and at least 20 additional companies of force had been deployed as the police watched four passengers from the train were dragged out and lynched And the toll would have been higher had some passengers not come to the rescue of the minority community and bolted the compartments An officer with the NCC in Lucknow who was travelling on the train. said We bolted all the doors and shutters of our bogey and inspired of repeated assaults on it refused to open the doors We assured our Muslim brethren that we would perish before any harm could come to them According to the district magistrate Mr Desh Deepak Verma railway officer Shrivastava lost his life while trying to protect the Muslims Perhaps the worst incident during the entire period took place at the Jogiwara locality near the Sasni Gate police chowk where ten members of family were burnt alive Their hutments were surrounded on all sides by members of the other community Then the town was gripped by rumour that some patients had been killed at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College It turned out to be baseless but the damage had been done The baseless report appeared in local Hindi. paper for the first time the local Hindi press assumed the role of the agent provocateur According to Mr Ashok Chauhan general secretary of the district Congress committee and Mr Pamod Kumar industrialist who has a two-member factfinding team to look into the incident Not only was this news item totally false but it symbolised the threat which irresponsible journalism can cause to the country's unity significant feature of the riots this time was the kind of weaponry used by both sides In the past knives or countrymade pistols called kattas had been used But this time the country- made cannon bombs and even hand grenades were used freely Even today both communities are armed to the teeth and can keep the city aflame for another few weeks And for the first time normally peaceful civil lines area also succumbed to violence Eight shops belonging to Hindus were set afire near the AMU campus and within the university mercifully only two cases of stabbing took place turning out to be case of mistaken identity What was the role of the AMU in all this According to retired police inspector who has agonised over the flare-ups since the early 50s Remove the university and there will be no riots in Aligarh The aloofness from the town has contributed to the ill-will To outsiders the varsity is the hotbed of insurgency training camp for fanatic mullahs the procreator. of Pakistan and the hub of panIslamic uprising Non-Muslim residents complain that the admission policy discriminates against the Hindus While the vice-chancellor denies this saying the policy only reflects the minority status of the varsity Professor Irfan Habib noted historian admits that the number of non-Muslim students has gone down from 35 per cent in the 60s to 20 per cent at present. But The blames the communal politics played by the Centre for this But there is more to the riots than just the Hindu-Muslim factor The first major riot iri the city in 1978 was chiefly aimed at grabbing five houses Muslims on Agra Road Today an imposing Chandra Talkies stands over the debris Another factor is that the major lockmaking industry is controlled by both the communities Hindus own large-scale industry while Muslims do this work in their households group of AMU teachers quoting various study reports on the economics of riots say that large-scale provoked communal riots to damage the small-scale industrialists financially As if to prove this charge all the small-scale industries have been closed in Aligarh since the riots began According to Mr Vijay Bajaj vice-president of the all-India lock manufacturers association This is the darkest hour in the history of the industry which employs at least three lakh people If one had to sum up the riots in one paragraph it would read like this The kar seva business heightened the apprehensions of the Muslims and prepared the ground for confrontation which was helped by easy access to illegal arms and fuelled by inflammatory pamphlets speeches and irresponsible reporting by the local press The fact that people's resentment against the PAC had reached flashpoint over the past few weeks made the outbreak of riots even more certain Add to this the monetary gains some people saw for themselves in case of riots and the alienation of the AMU from the mainstream and the riots seemed predictable CJ
