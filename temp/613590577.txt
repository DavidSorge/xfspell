Bogus voting the League was alleging that the Sena youth were intimidating their supporters and not allowing them to vote The national parties Congress and Janata Dal were caught in cleft stick even as they struggled to establish their secular credentials In polling stations behind Crawford Market Sena dada was distributing Rs 1 0 notes to some bedraggled youth While the dada refused to divulge any information an 18-year-old Sainik was more forthcoming We have all voted four or five times today And why should we not when the League is indulging in similar malpractices in their areas said the boy defiantly What about the indelible ink No problem said the young boy wearing saffron scarf You just have to rub it off as soon as it is put or else remove it with special liquid or even with blade In fact one Sainik whom this reporter met had cut his finger as result of removing the ink with blade Nor was anyone to be overly surprised at the ready distribution of the Rs 1 0 notes Our candidate has told us that money is no problem but make sure that we get all the votes in the area said the youth few kilometres away this correspondent was greeted by few more Sainiks belonging to the Mandvi shaka Even while hurling the choicest abuses on Muslim League members one of the leaders suddenly asked Would you like to vote Before an answer could be given card with the name of 30-year- old Abdul Satlar was thrust into the hand But as one was being led to the polling station the same leader suddenly said Sorry sir you cant use that card Someone has already voted on that name in the morning Where did these pile of cards come from? The answer was to be found amongst the slum areas of Wadi Bunder In an area which houses 6000 to 8000 persons mainly Muslim about 2000 were not allowed to vote Said Nur-ul-Islam fisherman when we went to vote at Chinchbunder in the morning about 400 Sainiks did not let us vote and tore off our polling cards But if VT Crawford Market and Mello Road were the scene of Sena Continued on Page 5# WlltlllUWt Sena Muslim League run the show Continued from Pane 1# dominance the writ of the League seemed to run in areas like Dongri McMonwada Bhendi Bazaar and Mohammad Ali Road Seeing the green flags of the League at one street corner and the saffron of the Sena on an adjoining street it appeared as if the entire environment seemed to have lost. its way under panorama of colour And if the Sena was indulging in malpractices their League counterparts were not far behind At about 3#30 pm truck with Muslim League supporters arrived at the polling station at the New Habib School in Imamwada Within moments the entire polling station was crowded and in the mad rush which ensued this correspondent saw boys no day older than 12 years cast their votes The Sena candidate immediately cried foul but when the police arrived most miscreants had fled as if in retaliation at an adjoining street Mahajanwadi dominated by the Jain community few Sainiks set about Muslim youth who were driving on scooter They even threatened to close the polling station on their road It required all the sagacity of local BJP leader Shanibhai to quell the seemingly bloodthirsty mob As the day wore on the frenzy of activity only gathered momentum at Sandhurst Road opposite the Navia Punjab Hotel there was bottlethrowing between Sena and League supporters Meanwhile at Siddhi Mohalla in Dongri the time for voting was coming to an end and Muslim League supporters were getting increasingly desperate One man was struggling to remove the ink from the vote. fingers of an old lady and some lotion It is not so easy to remove the ink on this occasion was the complaint But at Zakri Masjid Street in McMonwada matters appeared to have gone bit too far Two Muslim League supporters sitting on tonga were distributing pieces of paper among the motley crowd that had collected around them. Go quickly and vote in booth number 54 was the order When this correspondent innocently asked whether plain pieces of paper were allowed in the booth instead of polling cards the League worker said Booth number 54 at Junior No 1 Vocational Municipal Urdu School is ours There can be no problem And before this correspondent could get overly inquisitive the worker said look there is very little time before polling ends and we have lots of work to do As parting shot when this correspondent inquired whether he too could go in and vote the reply was Yes but unfortunately you don't look like Muslim League supporter But it is not just the incidents of booth- capturing and violence which were disturbing It was the manner in which the entire atmosphere had been vitiated by rumour suspicion and allegations Shiv Sainik claimed that Muslim League supporters in taxis and green Marutis had brandished swords at them while the Sena candidate alleged that he was threatened with revolver The League claimed that the Sainiks had not let some of their supporters vole and that they were just jealous of the League's dominance The Sainiks alleged that the police were favouring the League The League countered by saying that the police belonged to the majority community Every word uttered had communal touch Said Mr Najmuddin Bookwala an independent candidate from the area This election is totally different 1 have never seen anything quite like it But True tragedy of Umcrkhadi is encapsulated in the words of Mr Rafiq Qurcshi an assistant of the Muslim League candidate Over cup of coffee at Cafe Naaz in Dongri he said Twenty years ago Hindus and Muslims used to celebrate all their festivals together in the current environment that will no longer be possible
