Unique century THE imposing Victoria Terminus building in the heart of the city is hundred years old today but looks a lot more sturdier than many modern buildings It was considered to be one of the finest architectural iobs in the world by Mr editor of the Gazetteer of Bombay city and islands published in 1909 The building was designed by Mr FW Stevens who subsequently joined the railways supervise its construction and cost Rs 1635562 The construction took ten years and was completed in May 1888 The building has a frontage of 1500 feet and has several distinctions to its credit But the statues atop its central dome is really the crowning point The sixteen-and-a-half-feet tall statue symbolises progress The building was named Victoria Terminus to perpetuate the memory of the golden jubilee of the QueenEmpress in 1887 Several suggestions have come to rename the building but none of them has found favour Victoria Terminus is perhaps the busiest station in the world today. It handles over million commuters daily The station along with the building was once considered to be an architectural marvel It will undergo transformation with the planned double-discharge facility special postage stamp will be released by the railway minister Mr Madhavrao Scindia on May 30 to commemorate the centenary of the building The chief minister Mr Chavan will grace the occasion Allegations galore COMMUNAL riots in Vaurangabad and parts of Marathwada have claimed 26 byes and left many more injured. Looking at the allegations and counter allegations by the political leaders it is difficult to find out who should be blamed for the trouble The chief minister Mr Shavan has blamed the Shiv Sena for fomenting communal riots by making inciting speeches while the Sena leaders have blamed the Congress Party for engineering the riots to defame their party colleagues The dissidents in the ruling party have held the chief minister responsible for the failure to maintain law. and order while the chief minister's camp claims to have collected proof to show the dissidents hand behind the trouble Most of the opposition parties have blamed both the Congress and Shiv Sena for The trouble to make the picture complete the Union home minister Mr Buta Singh who visited the riot-torn city also received reports from two independent investigating agencies on each other The game of allegations and counter allegations may continue for some more time but it would take many more years for those who suffered during the riots to recover from the trauma of communal violence Only in name GROUP of eight to ten businessmen from Masjid have made it their business every evening to board the first class ladies compartment in the train bound for Andheri The compartment is nearly empty at that hour and the group seats itself comfortably to play game of cards When lady luck is harsh on them the men use all the tricks in the trade to convince the women that their presence in the compartment actually ensures their safety However if no objections are forthcoming the men seat themselves as far from the women as they can flash apologetic and benevolent smiles till the silent protesters look away If the protests are vocal and strong the crestfallen men jump out of the train to wait for the next one which will hopefully be free of protesting women There is clear. understanding that in case the train starts amidst the rounds of polite arguments those who are in the train will get down at Sandhurst Road station and wait for their mates Men at station's en-route to Andheri look in with bewilderment at the ladies sign on the compartment and then at the men playing away merrily inside They give second glazed look at the sign before scrambling into the train the last moment Questioning looks are sent towards the few women seated in the compartment The silver lining for the women of course is that they can safely get in with their spouses or boyfriends. all the men are gallant enough to politely offer seat to every woman who gets in at the subsequent stations Cuckoos forecast WHILE meteorologists the work over have taken to using super computers to predict the weather Serrao of the Bombay Natural History Society has developed technique much closer to nature to tell us when the rains are likely As the month of May comes to ai end Mr Serrao keeps look-out for the pied crested cuckoo clamato The arrival of this bird the size of common myna in the city means that the rains are only few days away The naturalist tells us that he has been proved right on five occasions in the past To all of us sweltering under the cruel summer sun it would come a bit of good news to know that Mr Serrao sighted the cuckoo on Friday 11 Hi-Aim Mml Ircw last He says he saw two of these birds at the Prince of Wales Museum and 1 while one of them was pecked to 1 death by crows the other is very 1 much around The bird is found in many countries in Asia and Africa Two of its races are to be found in India One of them the resident nominate inhabits peninsular India south of the 1 5 degree north latitude while the other race serratus winters in Africa moves into India during the summer to breed from the 1 8 degrees north latitude in peninsular 3 India northwards into continental India upto 8000 feet in the hills The latter race coming from Africa moves with the south-west monsoon drift and its arrival in its breeding haunts in this country indicates that Mr Serrao True to its cuckoo character the pied crested cuckoo does not hatch its own eggs but deposits them in the nests of other birds whose eggs are identically coloured The pied crested cuckoo is black and white bird with long graduated tail The species coming from Africa is larger than its Indian counterpart Speeding motorists PEDESTRIANS are supposed to have unrestricted right to the use of zebra crossings on the road But speeding motorists often scare away defenseless walkers denying them this basic right The additional commissioner of police traffic Dr Pasricha says this is not in the interest of the motorist either If motorist stops at zebra crossing her or she saves petrol In the meantime the vehicle traffic ahead has gone much further So the motorist actually has much more free space ahead and can now proceed at top gear He also reminded motorists at Rotary meeting recently that they should remember that their own children often used the zebra crossing and did not deserve to be scared away by cars. Many drivers he felt were not ready for Marutis cars because while the pick-up of these vehicles was good the driving was bad Some car owners boasted of the driving skills of their 1 5-year-olds he added When some members sought to blame taxi and bus. drivers for indiscipline on the roads Mr Pasricha said that While taxi drivers had improved lot bus drivers posed some problems He was quick to ask that the main culprits however were private motorists Serious lacuna FACED with the frequent rescheduling of some long-distance trains the railways have been compelled to eliminate vital piece of information in the computerised tickets trains departure timings As one can expect it has caused great deal of inconvenience to passengers Their repeated attempts to check with the railway enquiry office is not always successful because Lines are invariably engaged There have been few cases of some passengers even missing their trains as it happened in the case of an Indian Airlines official who wanted to travel to Manmad The official said that he was planning to take up the matter with higher authorities in the railways or if necessary even file case against them Confronted with the issue senior Central Railway officer. agreed that it was necessary to mention the departure timings But his justification for not doing so clearly indicated that he had not have faith in the present system He said during the summer rush quite few people reserved their tickets at least three months in advance According to him if the railways were unable to adhere to the departure timings mentioned in the ticket there was every possibility of the commuters dragging the railway administration to court We considered this and decided not put the departure timing he said False promise Tall promises through advertisements it happens all the time and banks too seem to have gone in for this gimmick as Mr Mukund Dalai client for 20 years with the Central Bank of Indias head office at Fort discovered to his dismay Mr Dalai had gone to his bank with cheque for Rs 304 drawn on UCO Bank Surat in response to weekold advertisement in the papers The advertisement offered Instant Credit for cheques upto Rs 2500 to clients with individual current or savings accounts which were at least six months old at any of 28 listed public sector bank branches However Mr Dalal's bearer Ahmed Zakaria chairman of the organising committee pointed out at the dinner the idea was to bring different communities together in amity and not just to have good time An announcer kept declaring at the function that the cream of Bombay's elite Society was present The predinner speeches dragged on for nearly two hours considerably delaying the eating But before the speeches began the guests were served the sweet Khirni The leader of Soviet delegation began his speech with recitation from the Koran Later talking to reporters the leader said the Saudi authorities were not allowing more than 20 Soviet Muslims each year to visit Mecca Haj couple of days later at the Anjuman-i-Islam school he wound up meeting in the it was time for The three members of the delegation wore their traditional dress but each had the Self projection are so many pictures of 1 Miss Chandrika Kenia in the main hall of her ministerial bungalow that one gets the impression that the cheque drawn against his outstation cheque was returned two hours of waiting discussions with an ferent branch manager and helpless general manager earned him the following information unless the account maintained balance to the order of the cheque or till the credit# came from the credit department of the bank the bearers cheque would not be cashed In other nothing had changed and the new offer described as another factor of our commitment to better customers service signified nothing Mr Dalai adds that the general manager admitted that there was such an offer but if the lower echelons were not given instructions regarding its implementation he was powerless to do anything Solidarity dinner THE Id dinner at the spacious Islam Gymkhana grounds at Marine Drive by committee of hosts has become an annual feature over the last 25 years The idea was launched by Mr Hafizka then president of the Bombay Pradesh Congress Committee There was feeling that the dinner this year would be cancelled because of the riots in Marathwada but as Mr is bit too fond of seeing all over her home Some of these from the walls by ate Congress workers last week multi-coloured pamphlet on the Indira Gandhi awards in the Hum Log Foundation has 1 1 And in 10 of these Miss Cenia is projected prominently The only other picture is that of crowd at Hum Log function Ind there is not one picture of Mrs Gandhi Miss Kenia also seems to have exaggerated ideas about the importance of the foundation The brochure also recently the foundation has immensely to the nation by organising drought relief fundraising procession which was led by its chief patron Miss Chandrika Kenia Within short period since its inception this generous gesture of the foundation has been nationally acclaimed Archaic laws SOME of the laws of our country are so archaic that their implementation becomes farce The legal provisions relating to obscenity in literature are sufficient to illustrate the point According to the act the seller is liable to be punished but not the buyer. or the one holding the stock of such literature When the police recently raided one such bookshop they could only catch young boys who had come to Bombay from village in Jalgaon district in search of employment The boy was arrested while the man behind the operation escaped In the case of prostitution also the woman is arrested but not the customer though morally he also is equally responsible perhaps more so It is also surprising to note that the police need tip-off to intercept obscene literature whereas passerby can simply shell out note and buy any kind of titillating publication he wishes The roadside bookshops exhibit such literature which is known as yellow in Marathi Tailpiece DESPITE the craze for the mythological Ramayan the revolution Kranti has won over it in Thane at least The election to the board of directors of the Thane Peoples Co-operative Bank was contested by two panels While one called itself Kranti the other selected popular name Ramayan thinking it to be apt for winning the election going by the popularity of the TV serial The latter panel even propagated the idea that voting for the panel which had the symbol of Lord Rama holding bow and arrow was akin to finishing the Ravana of corruption Neither the theme nor the popularity of Ramayan seemed to have helped the panel as the voters opted for revolution shows the
