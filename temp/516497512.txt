Nation On The Rack Economic Pressures Make Students Restive By ABRAHAM country continues to suffer on the rack of turbulent violence Uttar Pradesh Pantagar and Varanasi Bihar in numerous places Jamrnu and Kashmir Poonch and Jammu province generally Andhra Pradesh Visakhapatnam and the coal town of Kotnaguaem and elsewhere All this hard on the heels of Aligarh and Bajitpur And there is Marathwada simmering in the temporarily turned down heat of inter-caste tension students have been closely involved in all these incidents Thai is nothing new student plane or campus unrest has long been sub-plot reinforcing the themes of the main plot on the national scale But the current troubles do not for the most part spring from purely educational causes The customary growth has put students in the headlines tough question-papers tough marking poor canteen facilities student union elections are not what has them out into the streets this time In Pantagar where an uneasy peace seven old has been ruptured inter-caste student antais at the heart of the matter In Varanasi ire over the UP government's reservation policy is one reason for students running amuck smashing in one case burning buses and causing passengers injury the other reason is moved to alter the composition of student unions Throughout Bihar the state governments reservation policy already once revised has seen students for or against it battling each other for months In Jammu in anger over the abuses believed to have distorted the government's own reservation policy burst out in student-led rioting with caste overtones over what was seen as blatant ism in the appointment of 200 schoolteachers In Visakhapatnam the death of two Andhra University researchers in road accident has triggered retaliatory student violence In Kothagudem students blew up over the paucity of local buses Only in Chandigarh from what has been reported does student indignation seem to have been caused by specifically academic grievances EVIDENCE What does the evidence of student disaffection over all manner of causes not by any means necessarily linked with wholly educational grouses suggest Post- independence student unrest in India as studies by experts like Philip Altbach and others have shown and as empirical evidence everywhere bears out is characterized by the absence of demand for systemic change It is concerned largely with lesser problems related mainly to facilitating the acquisition of degree so as to equip its possessor to bold help in an increasingly competitive society Such facilitation is ally at the cost of standards. The very concept of standards is alien to those and they form the majority students who feel that just as everyone has right to lighter education so everyone has fight to degree As opportunities for university education expanded in leaps and bounds after 1947 so the pressure grew from students an increasing proportion of their first-generation literates to make it easier and easier to get degree Witness during this period and still in evidence but so the spate of campus agitations against tough papers and marking and for easy questions lenient assessment Politicians in the ruling party and in opposition were not slow to cash in on this upsurge of student populism Since students were volatile impressionable force with certain common characteristics and problems who moreover came together for long spells in fixed places they were seen to be easily The politicians were aided by the tradition built up during the freedom movement actively involving students in party campaigns tradition was in the post-1947 era naturally inevitably and successfully invoked to legitimate attempts by various parties to mobilize student support It is in this narrow sense that students in India can be said to be politicised Their organisations are and have always been adjuncts of political parties from which they take their cue on all matters. whether these concern them directly or not. They are not autonomous in the way that say the National Union of Students in Britain is They are not an independent social force with major clout like the press or like powerful lobbies in the way that West European and American students have been most conspicuously in the late 60s and still are if less LINKED It is even arguable that the two phenomena are linked that Indian students by and later are apolitical that they are not politicised in any meaningful way because they are politicised narrowly ie they see politics in the most catholi of the word through the eyes of the parties to which they are attached Had they been truly politicised as Western Latin American and some southeast Asian students are they would probably never have forged their existing links of subservience with political parties and would while having their own political convictions have been able to carve an independent niche for themselves in national life. As result of the fierce repressure they thanks to their ties with professional politicians were able to exert students how far the most part won the day they have except in handful of institutions made getting degree as easy as pie The progressive devaluation of certification that this among other factors has entailed has not bothered them the end has justified the means But that very success. has in turn bred problems The fact that degrees are so easy to be had has meant that the competition for jobs which possessing degree obtained at any price was meant to render easy has on the contrary intensified there are far more dJgreen-holders chasing jobs today than ever before There would have been no problem or the problem would not have been so severe had jobs been created as fast or about as fast as degrees were awarded But this has not happened and there are no signs of it happening According to Union labour ministry statement in the Lok Sabha on November 23 registered unemployed today number over 12 million an increase of some 19 per cent since April 1977 The greater instead of lesser insecurity than getting degree has paradoxically brought most of those who have one has led them to seek solution similar to that they devised when they wanted degrees on the cheap academically speaking In the way they have made it ludicrously easy to get degrees they now want to make it ludicrously easy to get jobs Once again the politicians both eager to capitalize on this fresh bout of student populism and afraid of its potential explosiveness are willing to offer their services These two groups desperate students and opportunistic politicians have between them come up with the policy of reservations not just for the scheduled castes and tribes but for all and sundry In this way competition is effectively limited and if in the process merit is at discount standards that horrid word again fall and casteism becomes more rampant than ever before then so be it NO. SOLUTION Again however this solution can work only if all or all but handful of can be active. This can come about only if new jobs are opening up so that there is enough to go round but since this is manifestly not the case reservations no matter on how liberal basis as in Bihar where 50 per cent of government jobs are now restricted to stipulated groups still keep vast multitudes out of the wintry cold of unemployment And they too have degrees So the battle is joined between those whom the state chooses to smile and those who must wilt under its frown Thus it is that students who must soon start job-hunting are spearheading agitations over issues beyond the campus and because they are as group facing greater economic insecurity than ever before they are as inflammable as tinder which even the merest lick of flame as in Visakhapatnam or Kothagudam can set alight Ironically the involvement of economically hard-pressed students in the wider society around them even if only to try and bend the latter to their purposes offers some hope that gradually their discontent may widen in scope and assume systemic dimensions Whatever the immediate self-interest that pits them against forces outside the campus the experience can only be salutary and education of the kind they can never hope to receive in the decaying intellectual graveyards which pass for universities today Only if and when such an evolution takes place with the present dissipated anarchic nature of student turbulence be sloughed off and students emerge in new skin as an independent formidable force for progressive changes
