Tension groups Sasaram By ALOK The Times of India News Service August 26 THE recent communal violence in this town can be directly attributed to the growing and fundamentalism among minor groups belonging to two communities For town which had never witnessed communal tension before 1984 Sasaram today is in the grip of these small groups of communal fanatics who seem bent upon dividing people. on religious issues Though die majority of the people in both the communities are peaceless, the minor communal groups have risen in stature because of administrative inefficiency Communal frenzy this time was sparked off following claims by both these groups in a situated beside mosque to the south of the historic tomb of Sher Shah It is alleged that the members of the majority community had not only encroached upon the land but also extended its boundary by laying bricks on its periphery In the last week of July the members of the minority community met high officials of the district and requested them to remove the end flag of the majority community from the The officials allegedly did not respond The matter was also brought to the notice of the Union home minister Mr Buta Singh the Bihar chief secretary Mr Sarma and others The minority members also met the high officials at Patna and threatened that they would not take out the Tazia procession on Moharram if the end was not removed Subsequently the district administration was asked by the Union home minister and the chief minister Mr Sinha to solve the problem at its own level Thereupon following several meetings of the Moharram committee members with the district magistrate Mr Sinha it was decided that the bricks laid near the boundary of the would be removed but not the flag The issue was to be settled after Moharram Moharram passed off peacefully despite intelligence reports that there might be trouble but the members of the minority community again presented power to the administration by seeking permission to offer chadar on the mazar situated beside the Tarachandi temple on August 17 the day Raksha Bandhan was to be celebrated The administration did not permit this on the plea that on that day the members of the majority community would be making offering in the temple as had been the tradition for years It is significant to note that chadar had never been offered on the mazar. on the Raksha Bandhan day The refusal of the administration to place chadar while allowing the majority community to take out procession simply lit the fuse on August 17 but the seeds were sown three years ago Sometime in 1986 an organisation of the minority community was floated in Sasaram with the objective to monitor development and security of its members However the organs fell into the hands of some anti-social and rabid fundamentalists who used it time and again to take up communal issues It is alleged that the organisation is patronised by some people of the ruling party and its strength grew with the inclusion of some notorious criminal gangs even from Cal cutta The body served as platform for the communal elements of the community some of whom frequently gave provocative speeches during the last one year One of them was controversial figure his cassette of speeches having been banned by the government for their provocative and confrontationist tone On the other hand some groups of the majority community too began working in the town under the banners of various organisations and were instrumental in provoking the minority community groups on the issue of encroachment of temples Sasaram has unique character that temples and mosques have been constructed side by side it is only rarely that one comes across temple or mosque standing alone on plot of land The groups from both communities began competing with each other on who would develop its place of worship in better manner Instances and the temples and mosques in Gandhi Kanim Tara Chandi Sher Shah tomb area The administration can be squarely blamed for encouraging the majority community groups activities at the cost of those of the minority community Not only that these groups used the municipal polls as an effective tool of communal confrontation Thus since the last two or three years all the ward commissioners have been elected on the sole criterion of their religion something. unheard of in Sasaram The people of the town in general have strongly opposed the comos of the municipality and this is evident from the fact that peace march organised by some ward commissioners on August 20 was stoned by people holding the marchers responsible for the tension.
