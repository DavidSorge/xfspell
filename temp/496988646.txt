even more important in democracy where domestic political differences are permitted for full expression with the result that foreign observers often conclude that that there is no overriding national loyalty To this extent the demonstration of public anger over the manner in which the Pakistan authorities collaborated in the destruction of the hijacked Indian Airlines Fokker Friendship aircraft at Lahore airport has been fully justified but such protests need to be disciplined if they are to have the desired effect at home and abroad if they get out of hand as did the student demonstration before the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi last week the harm done to the cause exceeds the benefit In this case the incidents have helped the Pakistan government to level counter-charges. against this country The damage done to Pakistan's property can in no way make up for the destruction of the Fokker Friendship It has merely given an edge to the Pakistan governments case that the Indian authorities are no better at protecting foreign property against mob frenzy than the Pakistani authorities at Lahore It is strange deaf patriotism which results in inflicting injuries on Indian policemen who cannot be blamed for doing their duty in protecting foreign diplomatic establishment under the most trying circumstances for worse consequence of uncontrolled public reaction is the opportunity it gives to antisocial elements to conduct their operations under the guise of patriotism This can sometimes do even greater damage to the nation than an act of foreign provocation disturbances in Baroda and Ahmedabad show how communal and criminal elements can cynically exploit public anger for their own ends Already more innocent persons may have suffered in these riots the number of passengers hijacked to Lahore The fact that the disturbances have broken out in the Gujarat cities which suffered from serious communal rioting in 1969 shows how dangerous is the current agitation has taken Past experience is warning that only the Times prompt and firm measures can prevent such trouble from spreading The impending elections are no excuse for time or delay The Indian people are mature enough to support any government which acts decisively in such circumstances and to suspect the crew of those who do not mind promoting civil disorder for immediate political gains From now on for any political leader to call for mass demonstrations on the issue of the hijacked plane will be to play with fire It is for all those who cherish peace and ordered progress stand guard against further efforts to prostitute national sentiment for political or sectarian advantage
