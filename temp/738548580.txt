EXAGGERATED FIGURES The figures of casualties reported to you are obviously exaggerated it is also not correct to say that military rule has been imposed in certain areas of Calcutta The military was called in in substantial numbers as a national measure in the first instance and when the situation worsened in certain parts of Calcutta it was given the responsibility of restoring order without any diminution of civil authority Our Home Minister who has just returned from Calcutta has made statement which you may have seen and which 1 am asking our High Commissioner in Karachi to transmit to you hundred and fifty persons including large numbers of non-Muslims lost their lives the latter mostly during police firing The sternest measures have been taken The police and troops are unhesitatingly using force against those trying to disrupt the peace Several thousand arrests have been made by way of preventive action At several places collective fines1 are being imposed as punitive measures The response to the appeal made by the Home Minister in Calcutta for cooperation by men of goodwill among all communities has been good and peace brigades are functioning The Home Minister has reaffirmed the determination of the Government to take the strongest possible measures and to afford the fullest protection to all citizens Many people who had left their homes are already returning leaders of the minority community met the Home Minister and conveyed to him their sense of reassurance LOSS OF RELIC 1 welcome your statement appealing to the people of Pakistan to maintain calm am glad to learn of the East Pakistani Government's determination to maintain order 1 also understand your concern caused by the influx of refugees from West Bengal though here again the figures reported to you are grossly exaggerated must confess to view our disappointment at your own statements on the unfortunate theft of the holy relic from the Hazratbal mosque in Kashmir which was matter of sorrow for the Prime Minister and myself Your Foreign Minister's statement in this context was particularly unfortunate Without shred of evidence the theft of the relic was attributed to Hindus and communal turn to the Hazratbal incident was thus given in Pakistan from the beginning The Pakistani press started the most virulent tirade against India and did everything to rouse communal passion uncontrollable pitch FALSE CRY While he emotions of its people in Pakistan over the theft of tinsacred relic vere understandable am constrained to observe that irresponsible and unrestrained statements in accusations against India and the false cry of Islam in danger had the inevitable effect of inciting the Muslim population of East Pakistan to take revenge on the Hindus still living in Pakistan mob of 2000 which allowed to form procession and indulge in violent demonstration broke loose and started reign of terror in Khulna and neighbouring areas lasting several days in which the minority community in East Pakistan mm all accounts suffered grievously It is the serious incidents in Khulna which led to the influx of from Eisi Pakistan and started the critic and resulted in the disturbances in West Bengal Our Government rejects in emphatic terms the thesis advanced that the disturbances in West Bengal are part of the plot to drive out Indian Muslims living in West Bengal into East Pakistan India is secular State and the home of over 50 million Muslims as well as of several million citizens professing other faiths The policy of the Government of India has always been directed to the fullest realisation of the secular ideal and to the creation of society in which all its citizens enjoy equal rights and equal protection of the law Despite difficulties and those too not of our making our Government has relentlessly perused this objective You nave in your message mentioned specific figures of refugees who have allegedly gone from West Bengal into East Pakistan These evidently must include in large part nationals returning to Pakistan in recent months who had illegally entered into areas of India bordering East Pakistan without visas or permits from the US. Indian Government-who under well-established international law and practice had to return to Pakistan The Pakistani Government in spite of repeated requests by the Government of India has done. little to prevent the illegal entry of Pakistani nationals into India The population of our border districts in Assam and Tripura and West Bengal has been abnormally inflated as result of the influx of such persons As you are aware this matter is separately under discussion between our two Governments On the other hand the influx into West Bengal of members of the minority community from East Pakistan which has continued unabated ever since the partition of India is a matter of history The number of such refugees who have been obliged to flee their ancestral homes in distress because of fear and lack of sense of security as well over four million VIRULENT CAMPAIGN Our Government has observed with deep regret and dismay the virulent campaign against India that has been carried on in the Pakistani press and on the Pakistani radio in recent weeks Even yesterday newspapers in West Pakistan had the most irresponsible and mischievous headlines disseminating entirely false accounts of the Calcutta disturbances hope that Your Excellency and your Government will do their utmost to end the tension and disturbances in East Pakistan and to instil into the minority community sense of security and well-being In particular 1 hope that Pakistani leaders and the Pakistan press would exercise restraint in their utterances and would do or say nothing to incite communal passion This is of the utmost importance to both our peoples RECURRING CYCLE 1 It is my sincere belief that the time has come when our Governments should put their heads together and devise ways and means of bringing to an end the recurring cycle of such incidents and disturbances in both countries These not only poison the relations between our countries but affect the lives of millions of persons who seek nothing 1 but to live as good citizens in their respective countries suggest to you Mr President in all earnestness that we direct ourselves immediately to this task As first step proposes that you and join in an immediate appeal to the people of our two countries for communal peace and harmony If you are agreeable my High Commissioner will submit to you draft of such joint appeal for Your 1 Excellency consideration MESSAGE President Ayubs message dated January 13 said My Government has been receiving very disturbing reports about the communal situation in Calcutta in particular and in the neighbouring districts of 24 Parganas Hooghly How rah Burdwan and certain other areas of West Bengal According to our information the situation in Calcutta is virtually out of control The Chief Minister of West Bengal Mr Sen in public statement issued yesterday appears to have admitted as much and has taken grave view of the situation. According to him the Indian Army was immediately taking or administration of five areas in the city and military rule would be imposed in six more areas when more troops had flown in There are reports of widespread killing of Muslims and numerous cases of arson involving Muslims both in Calcutta and the oilier teas already lo news agency report today puts the number of dead so far at 200 and the number of cases of arson reported from Calcutta yesterday alone at 200 Unofficial estimates put Muslim casualties and damage to Muslim property in Calcutta and outside at very much higher figures Some indications of the extent to which the Muslim community has been terrorised by these senseless acts of killing looting and destruction may be had from the fact that yesterday alone 14000 Muslim refugees crossed from the neighbouring West Bengal into East Pakistan and the number has since risen to over 20000 The East Pakistani Government has taken and is determined to continue to take every measure possible to maintain order but you will appreciate. that mass influx of terroristic Muslim refugees spreading out into various districts of East Pakistan with their tales of woe could precipitate very serious law and order situation for the East Pakistani Government 1 have issued an appeal to the people of Pakistan emphasizing the supreme need for maintaining communal peace in spite of anxiety and provocation that recent events in West Bengal may have caused in East Pakistan cannot help feeling that in thus taking the law into their own hands with view to driving Muslims out of West Bengal into East Pakistan certain elements majority community in West Bengal have drawn encouragement from the policy that the Government of India has been following over two years despite our protests and appeals to drive out Indian Muslims. living in districts bordering East Pakistan The number of such refugees who have registered themselves with the East Pakistani authorities had by the end of December already reached 95613 number have now been added 20000 terror-stricken Muslims who have crossed over into East Pakistan from riot-affected areas in West Bengal am MJrc you will recognise the gravity of the situation which has been creating anxiety for my Government and trust that your Government will take effective action immediately to restore order and peace in West Bengal such as would create a sense of security in the minds of the Muslim minority and enable these refugees to return to their homes have no doubt you will agree that this will be in the larger interests of both India and Pakistan -PTI
