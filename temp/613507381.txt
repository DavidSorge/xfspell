The Police Factor BOTH the chief minister and the police commissioner of Ahmedabad Jha claim that all possible precautions against an outbreak of violence had been taken despite this if the riots broke out it was UnA TTia inference is that the so-called antisocial elements are so powerful that the best efforts and resources of the Ahmedabad police are not enough to prevent them from having the way soft state indeed is in fact plain nonsense In 1931 tazia and processions were taken out under much more difficult circumstances than prevailed in 1986 And not single incident took Why it came be asked did the police not carry out a rehearsal two-day would have familiarised with the top of the area and would have sent the message round that the police meant business After all if the was stoned as the police commissioner has asserted why did the policemen posted on the housetops not discover the piles of stones is guilty of having started with the assumption that the trouble could begin only in Muslim-dominated area Nor did the police anticipate the spread of violence to the labour areas Obvious requirements of law and order could not be met because of rampant factionalism among senior police officers Perhaps this factionalism and its unprofessional demand on policemen can be attributed to a shameful dereliction of duty at the station level How else to explain for example hotel being looted and burnt down just across the street from the Ellis Bridge police station The only other inference is that the police too gave in to communal passions Fhe violence subsided on its own Dependent as they are on daily earnings which disappear instantly with round-the-clock curfew the poor people of the walled city had no stamina for prolonged confrontation The police had stumbled upon devious but effective strategy Impose curfew literally starve section of the population and bring it to its knees Photo Kalpesh Doodhia Photo Shukdev Bhachbett
