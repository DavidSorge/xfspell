By INDER MALHOTRA HPO nobody's surprise except JL perhaps its own Congress party squalid ploy to garner some Muslim votes in the forthcoming state assembly election in Karnataka has blown up in its face This by itself might not have been too bad thing were it not for the other tragic and grim consequences of the government's sudden move to start 10-minute Urdu newscast from the Bangalore station of Doordarshan now temporarily discontinued At least 23 innocent lives have been lost although the actual toll might turn out to be even higher Of the properties including private cars public buses that have been torched at times selectively there is yet no precise count No less shockingly communal tension has been roused to high pitch It would take time to subside if only because too many groups have vested interest in stoking the fire especially at election time The Congress let it be said in all fairness is not the only culprit Not long-ago the BJP too had tried to play communal card for electoral purposes when on Independence Day it had created tension and provoked conflict by insisting on hoisting the national flag at the Idaho maidan of Hubli major Karnataka town But there are two important differences between the performance of the BJP and that of the Congress First the BJP is party of the opposition with blatant communal agenda and desperate about locating. miniAyodhyas across the country The Congress has the responsibility of ruling both at the Centre and in Karnataka Moreover secularism is this party's credo officially at least Secondly the BJP had embarked on its stratagem well before the start of the electoral process The Congress has had no compunction in staging its messy manoeuvre after the notification for the elections in Karnataka and Andhra had been issued Moot Point It is of course moot point whether there is any validity in the belief that successful introduction of short Urdu news bulletin at Bangalore would have materially. influenced the voting behaviour of the minority community in the state But about the base motivation behind the ruling party's decision to play politics with Urdu fine language rich in literature and poetry which has been wrongly made out to be the language of Muslims only and has for this reason suffered needlessly since 1947 there cannot be any doubt In the first place the bulletins introduction was as surreptitious as it was abrupt Not only was there no attempt to sound public opinion but there was not even the customary advance publicity about it Secondly the vitiated venture was inaugurated on October 2 the 125th birth anniversary of Gandhiji which makes one cry out loud against the crass politicians and their craven bureaucratic collaborators for trifling with the Mahatmas. memory The third element in the unhappy situation is rather intriguing It seems that the ruling party functionaries closer to the grassroots foresaw the dangers inherent in the gamble sooner than the distant overlords in New Delhi did or could When Bangalore suggested that the Urdu bulletin be deferred the capital commanded that it must go ahead as planned The subsequent passing of buck and shifting of responsibility confirm yet again that while success has many fathers failure especially disastrous one dies an orphan According to one version in circulation it was the omnipotent PMO that stifled the second thoughts on starting the Bangalore bulletin in Urdu Another version claims that the information and broadcasting ministry was calling the shots to make the confusion worse confounded the minister Mr KP Singh Deo whose authority was reportedly invoked to shut out last-minute objections and doubts has gone off to Hiroshima On what kind of official duty no one seems able to say Cruel Twist While there is no doubt that cruel communal twist has been given to the Urdu telecast it would be only realistic to recognise that the raw emotions that have been aroused in Karnataka is a complex mix not just simple Hindu-Muslim antagonism There is one thing the understandable abhorrence of seemingly deathless politics of manipulation The introduction of an Urdu newscast at Bangalore Doordarshan six months earlier or ten weeks hence would not have caused ripple The storm burst because the timing of the move tore away the veil from the motive behind it Ford another thing there is strong feeling in Karnataka that the primacy of Kannada must be preserved against all comers There was powerful Kannada first movement in the state in the early eighties because of the perceived dilateriness of the successive Congress ministries in implementing the report of the Gokak committee on the subject sad and growing gulf between the Tamils and the Kannadigas on both linguistic and political issues has nothing whatever to do with religion though it has unfortunately been accentuated by the unresolved Cauvery dispute so much so that there is strong opposition to the naming of the main bus stand at Kolar town after Kamaraj and statute of MG Ramachandran there has been disfigured At the same time the bar association of the Madras high court has passed strange. resolution demanding that all those judges of the high court who do not speak Tamil should be transferred The resolution is clearly directed against the four Kannadigas on the bench including chief justice Against this background it is not at all surprising though it is highly ironic that the Union railway minister Mr CK Jaffer Sharif of all people has spoken out against the folly of telecasting the Urdu news bulletin at prime time cutting into the Kannada bulletin and thus hurting the sentiments of the Kannadigas He was it perhaps needless to add among those who had originally blessed the idea of wooing Muslim voters by pandering to their supposed love for Urdu Gone Awry All the clever calculations have gone awry however The Congress today is in the plight of the convict the popular fable who given the choice of subjecting himself to hundred lashes or eating hundred onions ended up doing both The party will be in trouble if it fails to re-start the Urdu bulletin soon though at different times of the evening and it would be in even greater trouble if it keeps its word For any number of literary and other organisations have served notice that they will resume their agitation in an even more virulent form if the Urdu newscast is resumed In all the simulated sympathy for Urdu the Gujral committees report which has been gathering dust for full two decades has been suddenly brought out of the pigeonhole it has been overlooked that Karnataka unlike Tamil Nadu has never objected to the daily telecast of Hindi news with proper consultations at the right time a Urdu bulletin could also have been introduced This might yet be done but only after the elections are over Better still arrangements should be made to link the English Hindi and Urdu news telecasts from New Delhi through satellite so that whoever wants to view any or all of these anywhere can do so without causing the kind of problems that have arisen about Urdu in Bangalore and have continued. all the time in relation to Hindi in Tamil Nadu
