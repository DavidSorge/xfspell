arrive here in chartered buses after their controversial sojourn in Mysore and Nandi Hills in Karnataka After presenting themselves before the President Mr Zail Singh on August 21 they took chartered flight straight from Delhi to Bangalore ostensibly to keep themselves out of reach of the money and muscle power of the Telugu Desams ruling faction of Mr Bhaskara Rao With the return of the natives. the stage will be set for resolving Andhra's most bizarre political crisis in which the stakes are high Both the warring groups of the Telugu Desam which had returned with thumping majority at the hustings last time have already been reduced minority The fortunes of Mr Rama Rao and Mr Bhaskara Rao fluctuate precariously On their return NTR flock of MLAs will go straight to the Ramakrishna Studios his cine fortress in the heart of downtown Hyderabad It is paradox of tile Andhra scenario that the shaky support of the MLAs for NTR and Mr Bhaskara Rao does not match the fantastic mass upsurge in favour of the deposed chief minister Congress leaders derisively call it mass ride but admit its there Yet the dichotomy between popular support and legislative strength is sharp and clear Ironically as it may appear despite his mass appeal those who have worked closely with Mr Rama Rao are totally disenchanted even disgusted with his autocratic behaviour signs to divinity dynastic and outsized national ambitions besides being bundle of superstitions Yet they have joined the Bhaskara Rao camp for other reasons Typical of the common man's reaction to the present situation is the comment of an auto-rickshaw driver NTR stopped the corruption of some people and officials and they have done all this to him he chuckled innocuously It is not the whole truth though Mr Rama Rao is on his charisma and mass appeal party to brighten his somewhat darkened image but mainly to overawe the legislators into supporting him in the trial of strength against the chief minister Mr Bhaskara Rao Mr Bhaskara Rao on the other hand is concentrating on winning over the support of Ithe MLAs Both have adopted similar techniques-one to regain his short-lived power and the other to retain his brief. authority SIMILAR STRATEGIES Both have their well-appointed camps for their followers as well as many doubtful fences sitting MLAs These camps have severely restricted entry to outsiders If Mr Rama Raos camps are in distant Karnataka Mr Bhaskara Raos are on the outskirts of Hyderabad with the added advantage of full governmental authority and administrative resources Both however feign that their followers are an innocent lot who have chosen to be guarded and protected Both are playing the game and are paying heavy price for the top place in the power structure Mr Rama Rao today wrote the governor Mr Sharma Tequesting him that his 144 Telugu Desam MLAs should be seated in single block in the new seating arrangement in the green carpeted assembly chamber when the special session opens on Tuesday for the trial of strength Other 19 MLAs supporting him belong to other national opposition parties and have their own fixed places in the House The former chief minister has also supported the view that the visitors galleries should be completely closed but has demanded that the Press the eyes and ears of the people must be admitted including the representatives of regional as well as national newspapers and agencies His demand has relevance because of controversial moves to keep out the Press except the local and regional ones and to block out or restrict all others In separate letters to the governor and the speaker the former chief minister has asked for full protection to his MLAs returning from Karnataka and participating in the proceedings He has given the route by which the MLAs would come from Karnataka and reach Hyderabad through Mehboobnagar district in Andhra They would be received at the state border by Mr Rama Rao himself and other leaders Six representatives of the Peoples Civil Liberties Union would accompany them from Bangalore to Hyderabad Continued on page 9 column 0 NTEs charisma Continued from Page 1 Column 3 They include Mr. Rustoraji Mr Appu arid Mr Arun Shourle FEAR OF VIOLENCE Referring to his Hyderabad chalo call to the people on the day the assembly meets Mr Rama Rao denied that it was an incitement to violence or bloody revolution He said he had only expressed his fear of bloody clashes if justice was not properly done and democracy restored He had asked the people to corn to Hyderabad to attend public meeting to be addressed by national opposition leaders on that day and never to surround the assembly About the speculation on the prospects of Presidents rule in the state Mr Rama Rao said he saw no such possibility He expected right things to be done in proper manner He said he would certainly abide by the verdict of the House if it is arrived at correctly arid in field manner Mr Rama Raos supporters fear that the assembly proceedings might be disrupted and justice denied His critics have described the Hyderabad chalo call on the D-day as an invitation to lakhs of people to disrupt normal life if he loses even in fair contest The House will meet on Tuesday amidst extraordinary security arrangements The sprawling assembly complex will be virtually ringed by large conof the CentralReserve Police Force and other agencies The state government has asked the Centre adequate additional force to meet any emergency and prevent any disturbances Already large contingents have arrived here in
