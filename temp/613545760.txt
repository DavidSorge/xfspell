Few back Rajivs move By SHASTRI RAMACHANDRAN The Times of India News Service NEW DELHI October 8 PHE Karnataka chief minister 1 Mr Veerendra Patil who has been asked to step down by the party president Mr Rajiv 1 Gandhi had it coming He had refused to see the earlier signals for what they were and is now in the unenviable trap of having to fight back from position of relative weakness. While Mr Patil is faced with the potential loss of office unless major realignment offerees turn the tide in his favour the greater damage is to the party Senior Congress leaders admitted on condition of anonymity that the party would be the bigger loser because of Mr Gandhi's marching orders to Mr Patil Mr Gandhi has the knack of hammering the nail into his own thumb said former Union minister Another former Union minister said this is not only surprising but suicidal Mr Patil is the softest of the three Congress chief ministers to pick on him and that too when the man is ill and in need of sympathy is to needlessly provoke Dr Chenna Reddy and Mr Sharad Pawar Mr Gandhi has been consistently cool towards Mr Patil ever since he assumed office as chief minister 1 1 months ago while he was wary of Mr Pawar and gave in to Dr Reddy whenever he found the latter adamant it was to Mr Patil that he remained the most unresponsive Mr Patil had been warned by the minority he can count on his side in his cabinet that Mr Gandhi would replace him at the earliest opportunity but Mr Patil believed that he could buy peace by keeping low profile and not doing anything spectacular in office He was repeatedly at pains to reassure the dissidents that he was abiding by every wish of Mr Gandhi and sought to dispel the impression that he was part of the axis being formed by Mr Pawar and Dr Reddy The move to replace Mr Patil was formally launched when the AICC general secretary Mr CK Jaffer Sharif held press conference in September to specifically criticise the quality of Mr Patils administration Encouraged by the response from legislators who were willing to join hands against Mr Patil Mr Sharif repeated his charges few days later There was no attempt to camouflage the fact that this was being done at the instance of the central leaders of the Congress It was around this time that Mr Patil suffered strike There was no official word on his illness until ten days after he was hospitalised Mr Patil was advised to keep the lid on the state of his health so that this could not be seized upon as the issue to marginalise him On October 4 Mr Patil got wind of Mr Gandhi moves to make him step down It was then officially revealed that the chief minister had suffered mild stroke and was hoping from September 24 to 29 The note said that panel of doctors attending on the chief minister had opined that he had mild stroke from which he had almost recovered Mr Patil was advised not to take up official work for two weeks The riots at Kolar Channapatna and Davangere claimed over 43 lives had shaken Mr Patil meeting of the PC office-bearers last week had criticised Mr Patil's handling of the law and order situation The meeting suggested that Mr Patil hand over the police portfolio to someone else This was cleverly couched demand for his ouster There were other indications too The most conspicuous was the deputation of an AICC team for a spot study of the situation followed by Mr Gandhis snap decision to fly down to Bangalore ostensibly to visit the riotaffected areas But Mr Gandhis mission was unmistakable to force him to quit On reaching Bangalore Mr Gandhi confirmed this by his actions He spent more time with cabinet ministers and legislators and MPs on Saturday night instead of going round the riot-hit areas to see the aftermath of the violence. He is reported to have spent just over an hour at Channapatna and spent the rest of his time on the night of October 6 assessing the mood of Congressmen Word spread that Mr Gandhi had come to replace. Mr Patil and legislators who were out of Bangalore were summoned When the denouement came the only ones to be surprised were those close to Mr Gandhi in Delhi former Union minister who has been. conspicuously close to Mr Gandhi in office and even later said that he was shocked by the folly and haste If collapse of law and order was the criterion then it is Dr Chenna Reddy who should have been packed off first The Congress president Mr Rajiv Gandhi who had come to the state to visit the riot-hit areas in called on the allied chief minister Mr veerendra am TOI photo
