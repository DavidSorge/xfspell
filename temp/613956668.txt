PAC loses credibility The Times of India News Service NEW DELHI December 25 with PAC welJLcome army BSF and CRPF This slogan appeared on the walls of Muslim-dominated localities in Aligarh and Etah in Uttar Pradesh during the recent spate of riots But it could very well have been seen in Hyderabad and Ahmedabad as well if PAC had been substituted by police For more than genuine operational bottlenecks and sheer inefficiency it is the absolute lack of credibility of the local police that forces district and state governments to call for paramilitary forces and the army whenever there is. an outbreak of communal violence The danger of course is that thanks to over-exposure these so far very disciplined and professional forces run the risk of also getting infected by the communal virus. In Uttar Pradesh the state's largest striking force the Provincial Armed Constabulary PAC has not merely lost its impartial credentials the latest riots have cemented growing trend with Hindus openly identifying with it and Muslims hating and fearing it It is viewed as being so partisan that in Aligarh its own personnel were attacked by enraged mobs But elsewhere in Aligarh and Etah the PAC jam was virtually went berserk in Muslim-dominated areas Police officers in UP maintain that the PAC is much-maligned Only the PAC takes on rioters in the streets but communal politics and misuse of the force have resulted in its current image they say Nevertheless the UP government had to call in 50 companies of the CRPF and 20 of the CISF which were deployed in Aligarh Agra Kanpur Meerat. Jehangirpur Varanasi and Etah The army was called out in Aligarh Agra and Kanpur but only to stage flag marches and seal off tense areas. Significantly the Central forces were not used to actually quell riots barring stray incident of firing by the CRPF in Aligarh That dirty job was left to the 220 companies of the PAC The CRPF's main job was to assist the PAC in house-to-house searches combing operations and in nabbing suspects These joint operations have been criticised by Central officers who feel such close interaction with prejudiced local force and polarized public will affect the discipline of their men In Hyderabad it was the first time that the army was deployed in such a large way It has staged flag marches in the past It inspired feeling of security but had to contend with an uncooperative local police force much talked-of incident occurred at the Chhatrinaka area when the police guide led the army unit away from trouble-spot when the detachment eventually reached there the miscreants had finished their job and escaped The CRPF and the Tamil Nadu Special Police were also deployed in Hyderabad As in UP the Central forces rarely had to directly confront rioters that job was left to the focal police which predictably left itself open to charges of partisanship corruption and inefficiency The Central forces were used more to prevent fresh outbreaks and in search. and nab operations In Ahmedabad the people's anger was directed at the local police and the State Reserve Police SRP It is common knowledge that the riots were sparked off on December 9 when eight SRP jawans posted in the Dariapur area tried to prevent group of youngsters from playing cricket in so utterly hamhanded manner that it blew into major clashes with two youths dying in firing thereafter Muslims turned their wrath entirely on the police injuring two constables and sub-inspector The police retaliated with teargas and firing in the air but by then the situation had turned completely. communal As the riots continued the men in khaki became the targets of both communities constable were stoned to death and another policeman lost his son Under public pressure the government had to withdraw the bulk of the SRP from the city so that at present only 23 companies have been deployed The bulk of Jhe policing in the sensitive areas is being done by the home guards border wing and one company of the CRPF During the height of the riots the army was rushed to three areas but was subsequently withdrawn from the Behrampura area It continues to patrol Bapunagar Gomtipur and the Vasna and Juhapura police station areas But once again the army BSF and CRPF did not have to fire single shot ugly confrontations were left to the local police This coupled with its politics and corruption. have made the police more unpopular than ever By Ajay Singh in Lucknow Lokeswara Rao in Hyderabad and Lester Coutinho in Ahmedabad
