JANATA FACES MANI HANDICAPS Fatehpur By Election By SASTRY LUCKNOW HHHE Lok Sabha by-election from Fatehpur scheduled for December 3 will not be candidate-based contest although for the first time in many rounds the chief contenders are from within the constituency Machinery the election rather than man will be the goods-delivering factor The goods will come in small Tather than large lots as is not expected by any of the castes or classes which are already bemused and crackling with divided ces or averse with unconcealed ference In that sense Fatehpur will be neither Azamgarh where the line- up on the rest versus Yadavs gave victory to the Congress noi Nidhauli Kalan where the rating Yadavs ensured Mr Ram Naresh Yadavs triumph Communal vote The decisive role of the election machinery and the possible splintering of the communal vote were unby Mr Malaviya an outsider from Domariganj but easily the most outstanding personality of the 39 candidates who filed their nominations Withdrawing from the contest rather like Mr Balirair Bhagat in Samastipur Bihar Mr Malaviya said Our state-level Congress should have been ordered financially for this election as it has not been ready to meet the requirements of party propaganda in Fatehpur cannot fill this gap at the hour Following Mr Malaviyas lead three other Congress hopefuls Mr Sunk Vyas Mr Ganesh Prasad and Mr Amar Singh dropped out by Mr Ravindra Pal Singh known for his resourcefulness and resources stayed on in the field under the cow and calf banner The Janata goes into the formidable handicaps. worst of which is virtually dismantled party machine because of inter-contrifts It has chosen candidate Mr Liaqat Hussain who far as is known possesses none of the assets required to counteract th drawbacks Within the party big foot steps will be dogged by Mr Kashi Prasad who is standing as an independent The Congress has an ex-MLA Mr Prem Dutt Tiwari as its official candidate with Mr Mahabir Prasad Tiwari as the rebel within the ring and Mr Jai Narain Singh ex-MLA as the foe outside two of the 39 candidates have had their nomination papers rejected on scrutiny and 23 dropped out Local candidates The Fatehpur Lok Sabha constituency comprises four vidhan sabha segments Kishunpur reserved Haswa Fatehpur and Bindki in tht district and one Tenduwari in Banda district As double constituency in 1952 it returned Mr Shiv Dayal Upadhya and Mr Pyarelal Kureel both local candidates In 1957 Mr Ansar Harvani ol Delhi won by margin of 20000 votes and in 1962 Mr Gauri Shankar Kakkad Fatehpur man supported by the Jana Sangh defeated Dr Keskar In 1967 and 1971 Mr Sangh Bux Singh of the Congress from Allahabad won by margins of 50000 The Janata wave of 1977 helped Mr Bashir Ahmed another Auahabadi of the Muslim Majlis then of the Janata defeated Mr Sant Bux by 15 lakh votes Sweeping through the sabha elections in June 1977 the wave bore the Janata candidates to victory in all the five segments It was the vacancy caused by Mr Bashir Ahmed's death in March this year that caused the current Lok Sabha by-election The electorate in the constituency has gone up from 614 lakhs in 1977 to 65 lakhs In the last Lok Sabha election the polling was 48 per cent But in the vidhan sabha elections the five segments averaged only 33 per cent The caste complexion of the population in Harijans and backward classes 30 per cent each Brahmins 15 per cent Thakurs 12 per cent Muslims 10 per cent and others three per cent The highest concentration of Thakurs is in Tenduwari 40 per cent and Haswa 30 per cent and the lowest in Fatehpur five per cent while the Brahmins muster strongest in Haswa and Bindki 25 per cent each and weakest 10 per cent in Fatehpur Kishunpur tops i Harijan and backward franchise followed by Fatehpur and Bindki The Muslim population is largest 30 per cent in Fatehpur and smallest in Kishnupur and Tenduwari five per cent each On the face of it Janata party's choice of Mr Liaqat Hussain who is by no means stalwart even in the BLD faction to which belongs is based on hopes of garnering the Muslim and backward class votes but in this it may be more than somewhat disappointed as it may be in its overall expectations Apart from the Janata wave the Muslim vote was pulled in for Mr Ahmed by his association with the Majlis and the campaigning by the CFD and the Jana Sangh the only two Janata factions which besides the CPI have an organisation in the area The Muslim of Fatehpur are much affected by repeated bouts of communal violence in the state particularly the latest flare-up in Alias that elsewhere in the country The CFD will not be unhappy if another major defeat like Azamredounds to the discredit of the chief minister Mr Ram Naresh Yadav Vigorous campaign The Jana Sangh is sore over repeated parrotted as it puts it charges about its role in the Aligarh disturbances and is otherwise cool towards the BLD with Mr Ram Naresh Yadav electioneering capabilities being less than masterly the only hope of attracting the backward class votes in the name of the BLD lies in vigorous campaigning by Mr Charan Singh himself but current reports are that such barnstorming is far from big thoughts Administratively the Yadav governments record has worsened since the last batch of by-elections from non-performance to non- governance It has stopped drifting also said wag If Fatehpur were sugarcane or potato-growing country the chances of Janata victory could have been written off right away The government is little to show in any of the tests which party in power usually has to stand at election time The Congress for all the glory it may hark back to in picking up Azamgarh for its Muslim candidate and three videos sabha seats has its own troubles this time Mrs Indira Gandhi was shrewd ai letting it be known that the candidate would be chosen by the Azamgarh victor and UPCC president Mrs Mohsina Kidwai and thereby localising the selection instead of making it appear like an imposition However Mr Prem Dutt Tiwari the man picked by Mrs Kidwai and the former chief minister Mr Tiwari faces opposition from the Kemlapati Tripathi group because its choice Mr Jai Narav Singh an ex-MLA who filed his nomination was denied the ticket Brahmin attitude Although Mr Singh himself withdrew Mr Mahabir Tiwari another member of the group remained in the field as rebel and will haveMr Singhs overall support and -whatever slice of the Brahmin vote he may himself manage to get On the other hand Mrs Gandhi will be the most outstanding campaigner and Mr Prem Dutts chances depend entirely on her It has just been announced that instead of the original three days Mrs Gandhi now proposes to spend six days on the campaign trail Fatehpur is the gateway to Bunand the backwardness of the region Historically every time it changed hands it did so by default of one party or the deceit of another It was conquered by Nawab Safdarjang of Oudhfrom the Marathas in 1750 but was forced by the British to give it up to the Moghul emperor When Shah Alam moved close to the Marathas in 1774 the British took it over from him and sold it to Oudh for Rs 50 lakhs In 1-801 they took it over from the Nawab in settlement of illegal and extortionate financial demands How much of its history will be mirrored in this by-election
