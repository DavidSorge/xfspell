Solanki ministry facing crisis By ASHRAF SAYED The Times of India News Service AHMEDABAD March 28 THE Madhavsinh Solanki ministry appears to have begun its second term on an inauspicious note on the very first day of its swearing-in major tragedy struck the city when 28 people died after consuming illicit liquor and few davis later the anti-reservation agitation turned into one of the worst communal riots in this textile city In fact the ministry has been facing one crisis after another for add to its anxiety an industrialist friend of Mr Solanki and supporter of the Congress Mr Mrugesh Jaykrishna was detained in Bombay for alleged contravention of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. All these factors led many opponents of the chief ministers to surmise that he would not survive for However the Prime Minister Mr Rajiv Gandhi who made an airdash to the city to visit the riot-affected areas on Saturday last put the guessing game to an end by declaring that Mr Solanki will not be disturbed None the less the chief minister and the home minister Mr Amarsinh Chaudhary had to keep close watch on the deteriorating riot situation As the home minister was new to his post the chief minister had to direct the operations against antisocial and communal elements who had virtually taken over control of the city in the first two days of the rioting The Solanki ministry which received massive mandate even surpassing the party's record performance in the Lok Sabha elections was confident of smooth sailing but suddenly found itself caught on the wrong foot facing such an agitation for the first time He had similar experience in 1981 when the anti-reservation movement virtually turned into caste war and spread to rural areas COMMUNAL TURN However this time the agitation Jjas taken communal turn causing anxiety to the state government and the people at large Beginning with stone-throwing between two groups of people in the walled area of the city on March 18 night the situation suddenly took communal turn and rioting arson and looting began on large scale Alarmed by the sudden turn of events the city police first imposed an Indefinite curfew in. the worst-affected areas of Dariapur and Kazipur and diverted the police force here from other areas for strict enforcement of the curfew For the whole night of March 19 it was not possible for the government to rush additional police force to the city because of the bandh though it had alerted the army -inc started making other alternative arrangements to meet the situation The army moved into the city the next day and held flag-march but it had hardly any effect for the first two days till the government mobilised additional forces from neighbouring Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and even air-life personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force from Delhi number of theories have been advanced as to how the anti-reservations agitation took communal turn Most of the opposition parties have accused the state government of giving communal colour to the agitation to divert the attention of the people but this does not stand scrutiny BJP BLAMED On its part the state government has blamed the BJP and the RSS for converting the student agitation into communal riots to malign the government and ruling party leaders have accused the opposition parties of taking the issue to the streets because the anti-reservation stir was fizzling out Yet another theory advanced was that disgruntled Congressmen had instigated communal violence 10 discredit the government Though there were many takers for this theory none could establish link between the disgruntled Congressmen and the riots One more reason advanced by insiders in the police force was that the bootlegger's lobby played derole in giving twist to the events Goondas and bootleggers who were hunted by the government following the killer drink tragedy in the city on March 12 were keen to divert the attention of the police and the people from them They are believed to have financed anti-social elements to trigger communal violence INEPT HANDLING Inept handling of the situation by the government during the initial days of the trouble contributed to the crisis In several cases shops and establishments were looted and set on fire under the very nose of the police who allegedly preferred to remain mute spectators curious development was the arrest of six personnel of the fire brigade on the charge of stealing silver ornaments while extinguishing fire Army personnel are believed to have caught this fire and handed them over to the police Later searches revealed silver ornaments in their possession There were allegations that some policemen looked after chasing away the miscreants who had broken open the shutters but these reports were corroborated with evidence 1 The six-week-long agitation which look communal turn on March II has so far taken toll of 15 in police firing stabbing and arso and mor than 200 people have sustained injuries Public and private property worth crores of rupees ha been damaged The turn of events has surprise many including the state authorities for the decision to incr the reservation quota for socially and educationally backward communities from the existing ten per cent to 28 per cent was announced by the government on January 11 and till February 6 then was no reaction to it But just when school and college examinations went approaching the students gave cal for the boycott of examinations ii protest against the increase in reservations The lead was initially taken by the students of engineering colleges who were later joined by it, others Soon the Lagitation took serious turn with students giving another call to the SSC am HSC examinations To prevent violence from spreading to schools and colleges the government and university authorise ordered the closure of almost all educational institutions in the state Many students challenged the governments decision through various writs in the Gujarat high court As the agitation picked up momentum and the students gave call for Gujarat bandh on March 18 th day the SSC and HSC examination were to begin in the state the state government thought it wise to abandon its revised reservations policy Just two days before the bandh day it announced its decision to postpone the implementation of the increased reservation quota for one year HOPE MISFIRES The government apparently the students would reciprocate its gesture but the announcement misfired and the students became more militant. demanding total withdrawal of reservations What has angered the students is the refusal of the government to accept the Rone commission's recommendations in the The Rane commission which was appointed in 1981 to identify socially and backward communities left out by the Baxi commission suggested to the state government to take income cum-profession as the criterion for helping poor people In its report submitted in October 1983 the commission recommended the scrapping of caste-based reservations and identified 63 occupations covering all the socially and educationally backward communities It also suggested that the benefit of reservations should be extended to students of those families whose annual income did not exceed Rs 10000 per annum Riding high on the crest of its 1 success in the Lok Sabha elections the Solanki ministry on January 11 announced its decision to increase the reservation quota from ten per cent to 28 per cent for educationally and socially backward communities. In doing so it put aside the Rane commissions recommendations and took caste and communities as the main factor for extending reservations This sparked off the agitation first in Aaron Morvi and later in The entire state Though the agitation in the city at the moment is in low key because of the communal riots it is fast spreading to other major cities and towns like Baroda Rajkot Surat Junagadh Broach Palanpur Mehsana and Bhuj While the government has now initiated discussions with student leaders to find solutions to the reservations problem there is hardly any chance of an immediate amicable settlement on the issue as the students have adopted hard line VULNERABLE POSITION The government has put itself in vulnerable position by making unilateral announcements about the temporary withdrawal of the increased reservation quota If it had taken the students into confidence at that stage the agitation might have died down by itself Now however it has nothing to offer the students as it cannot scrap reservations for schetribes and castes as well as the communities -covered by the Baxi commission Almost all the leaders of major political parties have accepted the principle of reservations to ST and SC communities As such the government is caught in piquant situation which it will be difficult for it to wriggle out of Some pro-Congress leaders point out there is something more to the agitation than meets the eye According to them if reservation was the only issue the agitation should have been called off the day the government announced the postponement for one year. and its decision to review the policy as suggested by Mr Rajiv Gandhi These leaders believe the opposition parties which are apparently backing the agitation want to give another twist to the stir by making it an -Madhavsinh Solanki movement Therefore they say game of and the government has started in the state
