How To Cope With Illicit Arms By SAKSENA OUT of the tragic happenings during the last few weeks in UP specially in Moradabad there has come wider awareness of few serious dangers which we face One of these is the unchecked proliferation of firearms both tickets The UP government has been quite prompt in constituting special task force to unearth illicit arms But it is extremely doubtful if it will succeed in the menace This is because even if the task force unearths ten thousand illicit firearms year this would mean that it can at best clean up one small district in sprawling state with as many as 55 districts Moreover while older firearms are being recovered there is bound to be much larger fresh inflow Another problem is that for the violation of the Arms Act the courts usually impose mild punishment invariably small fines The law can be changed to make stiff sentences mandatory But this can lead to injustice as illicit firearms can easily be planted on innocent people by dishonest sub- inspectors The key to the problem is drastic reduction in licensed factory-made firearms even though at present they account for only one out of every five crimes of violence Practically all organized gangs of dacoits use sophisticated firearms quite frequently obtained from licensees In the -prone districts of western UP the hiring charges of these licensed weapons are said to be Rs 200 per night. The booty from crimes is usually distributed to members of Dacoit gangs on the basis of the fire-power of sophisticated weapons Poor performance Again the bulk of ammunition used even in unlicensed Weapons comes from licensed weapons In few cases the country-made firearms are even designed to fire service ammunition The criminals who use indigenous weapons never use contraband or reloaded. ammunition because of its poor performance The manufacture of ammunition is complicated as it requires expertise and sophisticated equipment riot yet easily available to criminals The easiest way for the criminal is to procure ammunition on licensed weapons For weapons firing service ammunition the source of supply is smuggling theft or pilferage from government stores The majority of licence holders obtain licences ostensibly for their personal security Very few have achieved it through this method On the contrary many have lost their lives or limbs at the hands of criminals whose main objective is to snatch their lineweapon This should explain why after the outbreak of every riot the first thing the district administration does is to suspend all arms licences But the problem of illicit firearms now faced by India has assumed proportion far beyond the capacity of state governments to cope with In any case the Indian Arms Act of 1959 is Central Act and practically nothing is possible unless this is replaced by new and stringent enactment The problem is so urgent that even an ordinance will be justified The change needed most is that the denial of license should be left entirely to the discretion of the executive There should be no judicial interference at any stage When Pandit Pant piloted the Arms Bill of 1958 in Parliament the nation was under the spell of pre- independence rhetoric in which the Arms Act 1879 was designated by nationalists as British device to emasculate Indian manhood The situation has changed radically since then There are more licensed weapons in the hands of shady individuals than in the hands of gentlemen Can the states be trusted to administer new stringent arms act Judging by past experience the answer is no The act has been implemented much less on merit than under the influence of political pressure or corruption The list of district magistrates transferred for refusing to issue arms licenses to known bad characters is long one This is creditable to these individual officers But there is much longer list of those who could not resist the pressure It will be good idea therefore to leave the working of revised arms act to Central board in each state in which the state government should also be represented The Centralgovernment should have the powers to fix quotas for each state after scrutinise in the factors which necessitate firearms such as the Naxalite menace dacoit gangs the extent of the forest and hill areas the insurgencies in north-east and so on. In fact licensed weapons can be easily reduced to fifth of the present stock Private If the need for licensed firearms ammunition goes down to that level all private trade in firearms can be abolished and the police made strictly responsible for the sale and proper utilisation of Judged arms This loop will generate some corruption but the overall effect is bound to be healthy No responsible superintendent of police can afford to impede reform that is bound to help him control crime and save the lives of policemen The drive for the recovery of full arms also will become easier after the licensed ones have been reduced in number These may seem rather extreme measures But nothing short of them will do to save the country from disaster Even the doctored statistics of the police department show that the proportion of crimes in which firearms are being used to the volume of crime is rising fast The riot drill of the police mawarning tear gas lathi charge etc has become useless in several disturbances in which the starting point is the use of firearms by the culThe murder rate per lakh1 of the population has risen by nearly 70 per cent in the last 25 years all over the country In UP it has more that doubled To let young men learn the use of firearms we can follow the practice in Britain where virtually all the usable firearms have to He deposited in and pistol clubs for use these premises Here in Punjab Haryana parts of Rajasthan and UP firearms are carried in marriage parties and political meetings as status symbols In certain areas in Bihar bridegrooms demand sophisticated weapons as dowry The legitimate aspirations of the youth of the country can be sat by learning the use of fire arms in the NC Home Guards and so on It is not yet too late for us to prevent our degeneration into violent society It is mainly political problem to be solved politically It had long been ceased to be problem small enough to be tackled by special squads of the police
