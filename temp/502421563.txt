By JANAK SINGH BIHARSHARIF May 3 has raised its ugly head again in Bihar already it has claimed over 20 lives resulted in injuries to about 50 people and provoked arson rioting and looting of houses and shops at different places in district While this town which witnessed furious rioting in the past few days remains under curfew the trouble is spreading to neighbouring villages Several hundred families evacuated to safer places from villages and loin Biharsharif itself give the lie to the claim that the contagion is under control. Even funeral procession was reportedly attacked at Adamnagar today According to reports received here warring groups traded missiles at Lalbagh Garibpur Jararpur and Chistipur villages The induction of para-military forces into these areas so far appears to have had no effect on the militants Last night over 100 terrorised men and children some of them with gashing wounds inflicted by lathi blows bomb splinters or whizzing bullets were brought to The police station Tiere even as this correspondent was being told by the police chief that the situation is under control that the state government is trying to play down the magnitude of the violence is obvious from the statements reportedly made by one of its spokesmen at press briefing at Patna yesterday hand-out issued earlier -when the government had full information about casualties. said that only two people had died due to the government's anxiety to conceal facts it is difficult to say anything about the exact number of casualties Heart-rending stories about missing sons husbands brothers and fathers were heard by this correspondent in several houses which have overnight become refugee camps for people fleeing from riot-hit mixed localities It is possible that these missing people might be among the 200 taken into custody so far The administration could at least inform the relatives of people who have been taken into custody about their arrest to minimize the ordeal of the people now huddling in fear in the refugee camps However an official spokesman claimed that inmates by the police had revealed that only three people were missing from Alinagar While on the one hand the fearstruck refugees have no inkling about the whereabouts of those missing on the other hand they are virtually facing starvation Many people whom this correspondent met apparently. had nothing to eat for the last few days Barring small groups of armed personnel posted at couple of crossings in the interior of Biharsharif there was virtually nothing in this curfew-bound town yesOne person was killed when the police opened fire to an unruly mob violating curfew at the Sohdih area In Riharshartf of Nalanda district on Sunday according to Official sources in Patna terday With hardly anybody on the streets the town wore deserted look Now and then the eerie silence was broken by -made bombs eroding at distant places where despite shoot-at-sight orders warring groups were engaged in teaching other by hurling missiles VIOLENCE CONFIRMED Several scared residents whom this correspondent met in deserted lanes said patrolling or no patrolling warring groups were engaged in hurling at each other until the small hours of Thursday night before iricurfew was clamped down on the town The explosions continued to shatter nocturnal peace again on Friday Luckily are explosives and do not result in much damage unless aimed properly However they do succeed in creating psychosis of fear from which the whole of Biharsharif is suffering today cannot go out because fear 1 my neighbour might stab me said one of the scared residents round of the curfew-bound town revealed that the administration instead of healing wounds by rushing help and providing relief to the riot victims was by its inaction strengthening the wall of suspicions and mistrust dividing the two communities concerned Here and their plumes of smoke could be seen rising from smouldering shops or houses set on fire during the day senior official of the district administration who did not want to be identified Why can't the government hand over the entire area to the army for week or so to restore peace He added dont think the present administration can handle the situation Nursing wound on her arm at the local civil hospital woman who had been evacuated from Jamali Chuk village said. For three days our village remained surrounded by marauders Since all the villagers were united and hurling missiles at the assailants we felt safe As there was no let-up in the fighting we sought shelter in doctors house When the ruffians with the assistance of some of our own villagers started looting our houses we fled Had the police arrived yesterday or even early today they could have scared away the ruffians and at least saved our property All that we had has been looted It would be wrong to say that both the communities which had been living happily together all over Nalanda district until Thursday afternoon have been seized with moi id frenzy to attack each other Actually both the communities now appear to be in vice-like grip of mutual fear The Saner and sensible
