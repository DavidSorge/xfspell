Rathyatra gathering momentum By Prasun Sonwalkar THE Bharatiya Janata Party 1 BJP has started suffering from withdrawal symptoms And the 10000 km-16ng Somnath-Ayodhya through ten states is the first. indication of that If the response during the first leg in Gujarat is any indication the jug of Shri Ram is all set to steamroll all and sundry on its way to Ayodhya whether it is the Mandal commission Punjab Kashmir or even the National Front government at the Centre There were enough indications during the week-long journey through Gujarat that the minority government would be skating. on razor-thin ice by the time the rath reaches Ayodhya by October 30 Not only did the rath draw reverential crowds it also encouraged the BJP president Mr LK Advani to eat the political cake and have it too in the process he has also become something of messiah to the Hindus and emerged as mass leader For quite some time now political pundits have been underestimating even denigrating the BJPs. line oh the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri masjid issue The ground situation in the dusty lanes and bylanes of the country is vastly different It can best be described by the word Ram maya From the choppy waters of the Arabian Sea near the Somnath temple through the erstwhile state of Junagadh or the consumer capitals of Ahmedabad Rajkot Anand or Baroda it was an unprecedented show of saffron India. Saurashtra old men and women who stood reverentially by the highway waiting for the rather in scorching sun believed that another Sardar Patel was coming This time not for the reconstruction of the Somnath temple but for the Ram Janambhoomi temple in distant Ayodhya Old timers could not recall such turn-outs on the streets since the early days of the republic when Sardar Patel traveled through Saurashtra following the accession of the state Junagadh with India At first sight many of Mr Advani's Dublin meetings to be purely religious functions To add to the omnipresent colour of saffron Was the presence saints and priests in proper attire and clean-shaven heads Moreover throughout Mr Advanis presentations he was presented with an assortment of arms of all including the glittering Sudarshan Chakras which promptly swirled around his first finger much to the delight of all present Finally it may have to do more with the subtleties of the Gujaratil language but the announcements. of Mr Advani's speeches were invariably made as Pravachans religious The speeches however were anything but that Not few were surprised by the increasing of the genial sober Mr Advani who in other circumstances would be respectfully called The surprise however lasted for brief period when it became clear that the belligerence was part of conscious calculated decision of the BJP president split every political formation on Ram and Ram lines And as the November 1 989 election results showed Bhagwan Shri Ram is most effective campaign manager Mr Advanis clear measured words struck instant rapport with the people la Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee In state where the BJP won all the 12 seats it contested the public response to the has further consolidated its base and given it clean chit to endlessly nettle the state Janata Dal with which it shares power in Gandhinagar Not participating in the yatra arrangements Prominent among them were Mr Keshubhai Patel two in the cabinet agriculture minister Mr Ashok Bhatt minister for civil supplies Suresh Mehta industries minister and Mr Dilip Sanghani minister for public works Travelling on an average of 300 km per day delayed every day due to unscheduled stops en route The arrangements however were done with clockwork precision thanks to the organisational skills of the RSS and Bairang Dal leaders Despite senous apprehensions of intelligence officials the yatra did not precipitate communal tension and violence till reaching the consensitive Baroda This perhaps had more to do with the eagerness of the BJP and its front organisations to avoid indeed present confrontation and the skirting of communal tinder boxes en route This appears to be the approach until it reaches Bihar and Uttar Pradesh The BJP sources admitted that party workers and Bajrang Dal members had been clearly told not to incite or indulge in violence. However things would be entirely different once the yatra reaches the climax in Uttar Pradesh by October-end As Mr Advani indicated in several meetings and Ms Vijayaraje Scindia said in so many words during the inauguration ceremony at Somnath We will remain peaceful throughout. the journey to Ayodhya but if Mr Mulayam Singh or anybody else tries to create hurdles the Bajrang Dal and Hanumanjis blessings are there to take care of them despite Mr Advanis simplistic public posturings on the objective of the to create public awareness 6h the Ram Janambhoomi issue and to strengthen national unity it is clear that the party is gearing itself to face the electorate should midterm poll be announced The huge cut-out of the party's election symbol on the specially designed rather the lotus is significant in this context In Gujarat party leader said the BJP would not enter into any electoral adjustments whatsoever in the future Bhagwan Shri Ram the state BJP feels would ensure that most of the votes fall in its In villages and hamlets in Saurashtra and central Gujarat. Mr Advani recreated the Patel person and brought back nostalgic memories of the iron man by regularly recalling his contribution to the reconstruction of the Somnath temple The circumstances before. the reconstruction of the Somnath temple were the same as that of the Ayodhya temple now CorHor Potai tnn wine AncpA against it and was even called communal within the Congress It is only the warped political thinking developed during the last 40 years that is aggravating the Ayodhya issue After all you cannot separate dram norm roti Mr Advani said to appreciative all over He also went into great detail explaining the events before the reconstruction of the Somnath temple including the four notings of Sardar Patel So far Mr VP Singh has been setting the political agenda Mr Advani is all set to impose his own and the first salvo was fired from Gujarat soil Let us do what we want or else face downfall by December If the National Front government survives till October 30 and the temple construction is not allowed by then the BJP is likely to withdraw support by November-December when the national executive of the party meets in Jaipur by Mr Advanis own perception the meeting will be very crucial since it would discuss the events since last December Mr Advani has succeeded in the Gujarat leg of the in convincing Hindus that it is time to protest against pseudo-secularism and that national unity is comwith Hindu unity The idea has taken firm root in Gujarat and the fruit even if soured by the course of events can only benefit the BJP Passionate slogans about the determination. to build the temple at Ayodhya are invariably followed by full-throated cries of Bharat jai This Mr Advani explained was intended to bridge the gap between Indian and Indian culture and traditions which cannot be from Shri Ram to judge the quality of rice in bag it is enough to examine some grains in it Mr Advani said at huge rally in Ahmedabad and the response at Gujarat to the Rathyatra is enough to predict it or failure that which started beneath the imposing backdrop of the Somnath temple on September 25 Mr Advani may well be on the way to deliver his promise of the largest mass movement in history on the temple The BJP president Mr LK Advani addressing rally at Somnath before the start of the on Tuesday
